		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eye-witnesses and servants of the word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Both of them were upright in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commandments and regulations blamelessly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren; and they were both well on in years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Once when Zechariah's division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshippers were praying outside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> But the angel said to him: "Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from birth. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord their God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous--to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Zechariah asked the angel, "How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well on in years."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> The angel answered, "I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their proper time."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realised he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> When his time of service was completed, he returned home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> "The Lord has done this for me," she said. "In these days he has shown his favour and taken away my disgrace among the people."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> The angel went to her and said, "Greetings, you who are highly favoured! The Lord is with you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> But the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favour with God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> and he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever; his kingdom will never end."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> "How will this be," Mary asked the angel, "since I am a virgin?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be barren is in her sixth month.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> For nothing is impossible with God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> "I am the Lord's servant," Mary answered. "May it be to me as you have said." Then the angel left her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> In a loud voice she exclaimed: "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> But why am I so favoured, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> Blessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> And Mary said: "My soul glorifies the Lord</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on all generations will call me blessed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> for the Mighty One has done great things for me--holy is his name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> His mercy extends to those who fear him, from generation to generation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55"> to Abraham and his descendants for ever, even as he said to our fathers."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56"> Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57"> When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58"> Her neighbours and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59"> On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60"> but his mother spoke up and said, "No! He is to be called John."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61"> They said to her, "There is no-one among your relatives who has that name."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62"> Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63"> He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone's astonishment he wrote, "His name is John."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64"> Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue was loosed, and he began to speak, praising God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65"> The neighbours were all filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea people were talking about all these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66"> Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, "What then is this child going to be?" For the Lord's hand was with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67"> His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="68"> "Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come and has redeemed his people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="69"> He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="70"> (as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="71"> salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="72"> to show mercy to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="73"> the oath he swore to our father Abraham:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="74"> to rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and to enable us to serve him without fear</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="75"> in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="76"> And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="77"> to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="78"> because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="79"> to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of peace."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="80"> And the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the desert until he appeared publicly to Israel.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> (This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And everyone went to his own town to register.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And there were shepherds living out in the fields near by, keeping watch over their flocks at night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Today in the town of David a Saviour has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on whom his favour rests."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise him, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he had been conceived.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> When the time of their purification according to the Law of Moses had been completed, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, "Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord"), </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord: "a pair of doves or two young pigeons". </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> "Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you now dismiss your servant in peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> For my eyes have seen your salvation,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> which you have prepared in the sight of all people,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> The child's father and mother marvelled at what was said about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: "This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> There was also a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> and then was a widow until she was eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshipped night and day, fasting and praying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> When he was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast, according to the custom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> After the Feast was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> Thinking he was in their company, they travelled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> "Why were you searching for me?" he asked. "Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> But they did not understand what he was saying to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and men.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar-- when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> As is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: "A voice of one calling in the desert,`Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And all mankind will see God's salvation.'" </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> John said to the crowds coming out to be baptised by him, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves,`We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> The axe is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> "What should we do then?" the crowd asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> John answered, "The man with two tunics should share with him who has none, and the one who has food should do the same."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Tax collectors also came to be baptised. "Teacher," they asked, "what should we do?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> "Don't collect any more than you are required to," he told them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Then some soldiers asked him, "And what should we do?" He replied, "Don't extort money and don't accuse people falsely-- be content with your pay."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Christ. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> John answered them all, "I baptise you with water. But one more powerful than I will come, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing-floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And with many other words John exhorted the people and preached the good news to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other evil things he had done,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> When all the people were being baptised, Jesus was baptised too. And as he was praying, heaven was opened</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Now Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was the son, so it was thought, of Joseph, the son of Heli,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melki, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> the son of Melki, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> the son of Amminadab, the son of Ram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Kenan,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the desert,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing during those days, and at the end of them he was hungry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> The devil said to him, "If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Jesus answered, "It is written:`Man does not live on bread alone.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And he said to him, "I will give you all their authority and splendour, for it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> So if you worship me, it will all be yours."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Jesus answered, "It is written:`Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. "If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down from here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> For it is written: "`He will command his angels concerning you to guard you carefully;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'" </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Jesus answered, "It says:`Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> When the devil had finished all this tempting, he left him until an opportune time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> He taught in their synagogues, and everyone praised him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. And he stood up to read.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> "The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to release the oppressed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> to proclaim the year of the Lord's favour." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> and he began by saying to them, "Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. "Isn't this Joseph's son?" they asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Jesus said to them, "Surely you will quote this proverb to me:`Physician, heal yourself! Do here in your home town what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> "I tell you the truth," he continued, "no prophet is accepted in his home town.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah's time, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed--only Naaman the Syrian."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him down the cliff.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath began to teach the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> They were amazed at his teaching, because his message had authority.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> In the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon, an evil spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> "Ha! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> "Be quiet!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!" Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> All the people were amazed and said to each other, "What is this teaching? With authority and power he gives orders to evil spirits and they come out!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began to wait on them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> When the sun was setting, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, "You are the Son of God!" But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew he was the Christ. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> At daybreak Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> But he said, "I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> And he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea. </VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, with the people crowding round him and listening to the word of God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> he saw at the water's edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Simon answered, "Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> So they signalled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus' knees and said, "Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon's partners. Then Jesus said to Simon, "Don't be afraid; from now on you will catch men."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground and begged him, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" And immediately the leprosy left him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Then Jesus ordered him, "Don't tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> One day as he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law, who had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem, were sitting there. And the power of the Lord was present for him to heal the sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Some men came carrying a paralytic on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> When Jesus saw their faith, he said, "Friend, your sins are forgiven."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, "Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Which is easier: to say,`Your sins are forgiven,' or to say,`Get up and walk'?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...." He said to the paralysed man, "I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on and went home praising God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God. They were filled with awe and said, "We have seen remarkable things today."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. "Follow me," Jesus said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> and Levi got up, left everything and followed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and`sinners'?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Jesus answered them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> They said to him, "John's disciples often fast and pray, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go on eating and drinking."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Jesus answered, "Can you make the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; in those days they will fast."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> He told them this parable: "No-one tears a patch from a new garment and sews it on an old one. If he does, he will have torn the new garment, and the patch from the new will not match the old.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> And no-one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins, the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> And no-one after drinking old wine wants the new, for he says,`The old is better.'"</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> One Sabbath Jesus was going through the cornfields, and his disciples began to pick some ears of corn, rub them in their hands and eat the grain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Some of the Pharisees asked, "Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Jesus answered them, "Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> He entered the house of God, and taking the consecrated bread, he ate what is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was shrivelled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shrivelled hand, "Get up and stand in front of everyone." So he got up and stood there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Then Jesus said to them, "I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> He looked round at them all, and then said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did so, and his hand was completely restored.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> But they were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the coast of Tyre and Sidon,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by evil spirits were cured,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing them all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Looking at his disciples, he said: "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> "Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven. For that is how their fathers treated the prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> "But woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Woe to you who are well fed now, for you will go hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> "But I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> bless those who curse you, pray for those who ill-treat you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also. If someone takes your cloak, do not stop him from taking your tunic.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Do to others as you would have them do to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> "If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even`sinners' love those who love them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even`sinners' do that.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even`sinners' lend to`sinners', expecting to be repaid in full.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> "Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> He also told them this parable: "Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> A student is not above his teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> "Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> How can you say to your brother,`Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,' when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> "No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> Each tree is recognised by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thorn-bushes, or grapes from briers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For out of the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> "Why do you call me,`Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> I will show you what he is like who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When the flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> When Jesus had finished saying all this in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> There a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, "This man deserves to have you do this,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> So Jesus went with them. He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him: "Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one,`Go', and he goes; and that one,`Come', and he comes. I say to my servant,`Do this', and he does it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, "I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Soon afterwards, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out--the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, "Don't cry."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Then he went up and touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still. He said, "Young man, I say to you, get up!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> They were all filled with awe and praised God. "A great prophet has appeared among us," they said. "God has come to help his people."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> John's disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> he sent them to the Lord to ask, "Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> When the men came to Jesus, they said, "John the Baptist sent us to you to ask,`Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> So he replied to the messengers, "Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> After John's messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: "What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> This is the one about whom it is written: "`I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> I tell you, among those born of women there is no-one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> (All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus' words, acknowledged that God's way was right, because they had been baptised by John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> But the Pharisees and experts in the law rejected God's purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptised by John.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> "To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> They are like children sitting in the market-place and calling out to each other: "`We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say,`He has a demon.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say,`Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and "sinners".'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> But wisdom is proved right by all her children."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Now one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went to the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> When a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> and as she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is--that she is a sinner."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have something to tell you." "Tell me, teacher," he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> "Two men owed money to a certain money-lender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he cancelled the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> Simon replied, "I suppose the one who had the bigger debt cancelled." "You have judged correctly," Jesus said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> Then he turned towards the woman and said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven-- for she loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> Then Jesus said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> The other guests began to say among themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> Jesus said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> After this, Jesus travelled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Joanna the wife of Chuza, the manager of Herod's household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> "A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds of the air ate it up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Some fell on rock, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown." When he said this, he called out, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> His disciples asked him what this parable meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> He said, "The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, "`though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> "This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life's worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> "No-one lights a lamp and hides it in a jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, he puts it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken from him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Now Jesus' mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> He replied, "My mother and brothers are those who hear God's word and put it into practice."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> One day Jesus said to his disciples, "Let's go over to the other side of the lake." So they got into a boat and set out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> The disciples went and woke him, saying, "Master, Master, we're going to drown!" He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> "Where is your faith?" he asked his disciples. In fear and amazement they asked one another, "Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don't torture me!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> For Jesus had commanded the evil spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" "Legion," he replied, because many demons had gone into him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> And they begged him repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into them, and he gave them permission.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> "Return home and tell how much God has done for you." So the man went away and told all over the town how much Jesus had done for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> Then a man named Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come to his house</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no-one could heal her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> "Who touched me?" Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, "Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> But Jesus said, "Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> Then he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. "Your daughter is dead," he said. "Don't bother the teacher any more."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, "Don't be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child's father and mother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. "Stop wailing," Jesus said. "She is not dead but asleep."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> But he took her by the hand and said, "My child, get up!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55"> Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56"> Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> He told them: "Take nothing for the journey--no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra tunic.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> If people do not welcome you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave their town, as a testimony against them."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> So they set out and went from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing people everywhere.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he was perplexed, because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> But Herod said, "I beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such things about?" And he tried to see him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said, "Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> He replied, "You give them something to eat." They answered, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish-- unless we go and buy food for all this crowd."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> (About five thousand men were there.) But he said to his disciples, "Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> The disciples did so, and everybody sat down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to set before the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, "Who do the crowds say I am?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> "But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?" Peter answered, "The Christ of God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And he said, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Then he said to them all: "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit his very self?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Two men, Moses and Elijah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> appeared in glorious splendour, talking with Jesus. They spoke about his departure, which he was about to bring to fulfilment at Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, "Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters-- one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah." (He did not know what he was saying.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> A voice came from the cloud, saying, "This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> When the voice had spoken, they found that Jesus was alone. The disciples kept this to themselves, and told no-one at that time what they had seen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> A man in the crowd called out, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they could not."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> "O unbelieving and perverse generation," Jesus replied, "how long shall I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son here."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the evil spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> And they were all amazed at the greatness of God. While everyone was marvelling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> "Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you: The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> But they did not understand what this meant. It was hidden from them, so that they did not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> An argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a little child and made him stand beside him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> Then he said to them, "Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For he who is least among you all--he is the greatest."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> "Master," said John, "we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> "Do not stop him," Jesus said, "for whoever is not against you is for you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> And he sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> but the people there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, "Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them?" </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55"> But Jesus turned and rebuked them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56"> and they went to another village.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57"> As they were walking along the road, a man said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58"> Jesus replied, "Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59"> He said to another man, "Follow me." But the man replied, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60"> Jesus said to him, "Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61"> Still another said, "I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say good-bye to my family."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62"> Jesus replied, "No-one who puts his hand to the plough and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God."</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> He told them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Do not take a purse or bag or sandals; and do not greet anyone on the road.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> "When you enter a house, first say,`Peace to this house.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> If a man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; if not, it will return to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Stay in that house, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> "When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is set before you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Heal the sick who are there and tell them,`The kingdom of God is near you.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> `Even the dust of your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God is near.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> "Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the skies? No, you will go down to the depths. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> "He who listens to you listens to me; he who rejects you rejects me; but he who rejects me rejects him who sent me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> The seventy-two returned with joy and said, "Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> He replied, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> "All things have been committed to me by my Father. No-one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no-one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, "Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. "Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> "What is written in the Law?" he replied. "How do you read it?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> He answered: "`Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and,`Love your neighbour as yourself.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> "You have answered correctly," Jesus replied. "Do this and you will live."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbour?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> In reply Jesus said: "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half-dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> But a Samaritan, as he travelled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper.`Look after him,' he said,`and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> "Which of these three do you think was a neighbour to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> The expert in the law replied, "The one who had mercy on him." Jesus told him, "Go and do likewise."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, "Lord, don't you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> "Martha, Martha," the Lord answered, "you are worried and upset about many things,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> but only one thing is needed. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> He said to them, "When you pray, say: "`Father, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Give us each day our daily bread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against us. And lead us not into temptation.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Then he said to them, "Suppose one of you has a friend, and he goes to him at midnight and says,`Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> because a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have nothing to set before him.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> "Then the one inside answers,`Don't bother me. The door is already locked, and my children are with me in bed. I can't get up and give you anything.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> I tell you, though he will not get up and give him the bread because he is his friend, yet because of the man's boldness he will get up and give him as much as he needs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> "So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> "Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon left, the man who had been mute spoke, and the crowd was amazed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> But some of them said, "By Beelzebub, the prince of demons, he is driving out demons."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Others tested him by asking for a sign from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them: "Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? I say this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebub.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your followers drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> "When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are safe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armour in which the man trusted and divides up the spoils.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> "He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me, scatters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> "When an evil spirit comes out of a man, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says,`I will return to the house I left.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that man is worse than the first."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out, "Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> He replied, "Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> As the crowds increased, Jesus said, "This is a wicked generation. It asks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and now one greater than Solomon is here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> "No-one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden, or under a bowl. Instead he puts it on its stand, so that those who come in may see the light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are good, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are bad, your body also is full of darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark, it will be completely lighted, as when the light of a lamp shines on you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> When Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him; so he went in and reclined at the table.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> But the Pharisee, noticing that Jesus did not first wash before the meal, was surprised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> Then the Lord said to him, "Now then, you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> You foolish people! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> But give what is inside [the dish] to the poor, and everything will be clean for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> "Woe to you Pharisees, because you give God a tenth of your mint, rue and all other kinds of garden herbs, but you neglect justice and the love of God. You should have practised the latter without leaving the former undone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> "Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and greetings in the market-places.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> "Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, which men walk over without knowing it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> One of the experts in the law answered him, "Teacher, when you say these things, you insult us also."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> Jesus replied, "And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> "Woe to you, because you build tombs for the prophets, and it was your forefathers who killed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> So you testify that you approve of what your forefathers did; they killed the prophets, and you build their tombs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> Because of this, God in his wisdom said,`I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> Therefore this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, this generation will be held responsible for it all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> "Woe to you experts in the law, because you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> When Jesus left there, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with questions,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> waiting to catch him in something he might say.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Meanwhile, when a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so that they were trampling on one another, Jesus began to speak first to his disciples, saying: "Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> "I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear him who, after the killing of the body, has power to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> "I tell you, whoever acknowledges me before men, the Son of Man will also acknowledge him before the angels of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> But he who disowns me before men will be disowned before the angels of God.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="11"> "When you are brought before synagogues, rulers and authorities, do not worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what you should say."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Someone in the crowd said to him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Jesus replied, "Man, who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Then he said to them, "Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And he told them this parable: "The ground of a certain rich man produced a good crop.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> He thought to himself,`What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> "Then he said,`This is what I'll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And I'll say to myself, "You have plenty of good things laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry."'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> "But God said to him,`You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> "This is how it will be with anyone who stores up things for himself but is not rich towards God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Then Jesus said to his disciples: "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Life is more than food, and the body more than clothes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="35"> "Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Jesus answered, "Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them--do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Then he told this parable: "A man had a fig-tree, planted in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it, but did not find any.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard,`For three years now I've been coming to look for fruit on this fig-tree and haven't found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> "`Sir,' the man replied,`leave it alone for one more year, and I'll dig round it and fertilise it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, "Woman, you are set free from your infirmity."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Then he put his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue ruler said to the people, "There are six days for work. So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> The Lord answered him, "You hypocrites! Doesn't each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Then Jesus asked, "What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I compare it to?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air perched in its branches."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Again he asked, "What shall I compare the kingdom of God to?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it worked all through the dough."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Then Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he made his way to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Someone asked him, "Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?" He said to them,</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent Pharisee, he was being carefully watched.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> There in front of him was a man suffering from dropsy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, he healed him and sent him away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Then he asked them, "If one of you has a son or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull him out?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And they had nothing to say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honour at the table, he told them this parable:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> "When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honour, for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you,`Give this man your seat.' Then, humiliated, you will have to take the least important place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> But when you are invited, take the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he will say to you,`Friend, move up to a better place.' Then you will be honoured in the presence of all your fellow guests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Then Jesus said to his host, "When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or relatives, or your rich neighbours; if you do, they may invite you back and so you will be repaid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus, "Blessed is the man who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Jesus replied: "A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited,`Come, for everything is now ready.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> "But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said,`I have just bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> "Another said,`I have just bought five yoke of oxen, and I'm on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> "Still another said,`I have just got married, so I can't come.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> "The servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant,`Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> "`Sir,' the servant said,`what you ordered has been done, but there is still room.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> "Then the master told his servant,`Go out to the roads and country lanes and make them come in, so that my house will be full.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> I tell you, not one of those men who were invited will get a taste of my banquet.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Large crowds were travelling with Jesus, and turning to them he said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> "If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters--yes, even his own life--he cannot be my disciple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And anyone who does not carry his cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> "Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Will he not first sit down and estimate the cost to see if he has enough money to complete it?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> For if he lays the foundation and is not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> saying,`This fellow began to build and was not able to finish.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> "Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Will he not first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> In the same way, any of you who does not give up everything he has cannot be my disciple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> "Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again?</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now the tax collectors and "sinners" were all gathering round to hear him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, "This man welcomes sinners, and eats with them."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Then Jesus told them this parable:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> "Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Does he not leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbours together and says,`Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> "Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Does she not light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbours together and says,`Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Jesus continued: "There was a man who had two sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> The younger one said to his father,`Father, give me my share of the estate.' So he divided his property between them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> "Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no-one gave him anything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> "When he came to his senses, he said,`How many of my father's hired men have food to spare, and here I am starving to death!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired men.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> So he got up and went to his father. "But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> "The son said to him,`Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> "But the father said to his servants,`Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let's have a feast and celebrate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.' So they began to celebrate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> "Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> `Your brother has come,' he replied,`and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> "The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Jesus told his disciples: "There was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> So he called him in and asked him,`What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> "The manager said to himself,`What shall I do now? My master is taking away my job. I'm not strong enough to dig, and I'm ashamed to beg--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> I know what I'll do so that, when I lose my job here, people will welcome me into their houses.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> "So he called in each one of his master's debtors. He asked the first,`How much do you owe my master?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> "`Eight hundred gallons of olive oil,' he replied. "The manager told him,`Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> "Then he asked the second,`And how much do you owe?' "`A thousand bushels of wheat,' he replied. "He told him,`Take your bill and make it eight hundred.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> "The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10"> "Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches?</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="13"> "No servant can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and were sneering at Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> He said to them, "You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of men, but God knows your hearts. What is highly valued among men is detestable in God's sight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> "The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time, the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="21"> nor will people say,`Here it is,' or`There it is,' because the kingdom of God is within you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Then he said to his disciples, "The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5"> yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won't eventually wear me out with her coming!'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And the Lord said, "Listen to what the unjust judge says.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else, Jesus told this parable:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> "Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself:`God, I thank you that I am not like other men--robbers, evildoers, adulterers--or even like this tax collector.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> "But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said,`God, have mercy on me, a sinner.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> "I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> People were also bringing babies to Jesus to have him touch them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> But Jesus called the children to him and said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> A certain ruler asked him, "Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> "Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No-one is good-- except God alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> You know the commandments:`Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honour your father and mother.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> "All these I have kept since I was a boy," he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> When Jesus heard this, he said to him, "You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was a man of great wealth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Jesus looked at him and said, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Those who heard this asked, "Who then can be saved?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Jesus replied, "What is impossible with men is possible with God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Peter said to him, "We have left all we had to follow you!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> "I tell you the truth," Jesus said to them, "no-one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> will fail to receive many times as much in this age and, in the age to come, eternal life."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them, "We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> He will be turned over to the Gentiles. They will mock him, insult him, spit on him, flog him and kill him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> On the third day he will rise again."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> The disciples did not understand any of this. Its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> They told him, "Jesus of Nazareth is passing by."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> He called out, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> "What do you want me to do for you?" "Lord, I want to see," he replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight; your faith has healed you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they also praised God.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> He wanted to see who Jesus was, but being a short man he could not, because of the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> All the people saw this and began to mutter, "He has gone to be the guest of a`sinner'."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, "Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> While they were listening to this, he went on to tell them a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> He said: "A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas.`Put this money to work,' he said,`until I come back.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> "But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say,`We don't want this man to be our king.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> "He was made king, however, and returned home. Then he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money, in order to find out what they had gained with it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> "The first one came and said,`Sir, your mina has earned ten more.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> "`Well done, my good servant!' his master replied.`Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> "The second came and said,`Sir, your mina has earned five more.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> "His master answered,`You take charge of five cities.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> "Then another servant came and said,`Sir, here is your mina; I have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> "His master replied,`I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant! You knew, did you, that I am a hard man, taking out what I did not put in, and reaping what I did not sow?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Why then didn't you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected it with interest?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> "Then he said to those standing by,`Take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> "`Sir,' they said,`he already has ten!'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> "He replied,`I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but as for the one who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be a king over them--bring them here and kill them in front of me.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> After Jesus had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> "Go to the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no-one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> If anyone asks you,`Why are you untying it?' tell him,`The Lord needs it.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Those who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, "Why are you untying the colt?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> They replied, "The Lord needs it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> They brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> As he went along, people spread their cloaks on the road.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> When he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> "Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!" "Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, "Teacher, rebuke your disciples!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> "I tell you," he replied, "if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> and said, "If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace--but now it is hidden from your eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognise the time of God's coming to you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> Then he entered the temple area and began driving out those who were selling.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> "It is written," he said to them, "`My house will be a house of prayer'; but you have made it`a den of robbers'."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> Every day he was teaching at the temple. But the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the leaders among the people were trying to kill him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> Yet they could not find any way to do it, because all the people hung on his words.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> One day as he was teaching the people in the temple courts and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, together with the elders, came up to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> "Tell us by what authority you are doing these things," they said. "Who gave you this authority?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> He replied, "I will also ask you a question. Tell me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> John's baptism--was it from heaven, or from men?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say,`From heaven', he will ask,`Why didn't you believe him?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> But if we say,`From men', all the people will stone us, because they are persuaded that John was a prophet."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> So they answered, "We don't know where it was from."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> He went on to tell the people this parable: "A man planted a vineyard, rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> He sent another servant, but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> "Then the owner of the vineyard said,`What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> "But when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over.`This is the heir,' they said.`Let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. "What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others." When the people heard this, they said, "May this never be!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Jesus looked directly at them and asked, "Then what is the meaning of that which is written: "`The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone'?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Keeping a close watch on him, they sent spies, who pretended to be honest. They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> So the spies questioned him: "Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> He saw through their duplicity and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> "Show me a denarius. Whose portrait and inscription are on it?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> "Caesar's," they replied. He said to them, "Then give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> They were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public. And astonished by his answer, they became silent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> "Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> The second</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> and then the third married her, and in the same way the seven died, leaving no children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Finally, the woman died too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> Now then, at the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Jesus replied, "The people of this age marry and are given in marriage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> But those who are considered worthy of taking part in that age and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God's children, since they are children of the resurrection.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> But in the account of the bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord`the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> Some of the teachers of the law responded, "Well said, teacher!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> And no-one dared to ask him any more questions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> Then Jesus said to them, "How is it that they say the Christ is the Son of David?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> David himself declares in the Book of Psalms: "`The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> David calls him`Lord'. How then can he be his son?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> While all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> "Beware of the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted in the market-places and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honour at banquets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Such men will be punished most severely."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> As he looked up, Jesus saw the rich putting their gifts into the temple treasury.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> He also saw a poor widow put in two very small copper coins. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> "I tell you the truth," he said, "this poor widow has put in more than all the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> All these people gave their gifts out of their wealth; but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Some of his disciples were remarking about how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and with gifts dedicated to God. But Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> "As for what you see here, the time will come when not one stone will be left on another; every one of them will be thrown down."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> "Teacher," they asked, "when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> He replied: "Watch out that you are not deceived. For many will come in my name, claiming,`I am he,' and`The time is near.' Do not follow them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> When you hear of wars and revolutions, do not be frightened. These things must happen first, but the end will not come right away."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Then he said to them: "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> There will be great earthquakes, famines and pestilences in various places, and fearful events and great signs from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> "But before all this, they will lay hands on you and persecute you. They will deliver you to synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors, and all on account of my name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> This will result in your being witnesses to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> But make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers, relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> All men will hate you because of me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> But not a hair of your head will perish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> By standing firm you will gain life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> "When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country not enter the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> For this is the time of punishment in fulfilment of all that has been written.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! There will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> They will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> "There will be signs in the sun, moon and stars. On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Men will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> He told them this parable: "Look at the fig-tree and all the trees.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that the kingdom of God is near.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> "I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> "Be careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with dissipation, drunkenness and the anxieties of life, and that day will close on you unexpectedly like a trap.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> For it will come upon all those who live on the face of the whole earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Be always on the watch, and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen, and that you may be able to stand before the Son of Man."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Each day Jesus was teaching at the temple, and each evening he went out to spend the night on the hill called the Mount of Olives,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> and all the people came early in the morning to hear him at the temple.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> They were delighted and agreed to give him money.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> "Where do you want us to prepare for it?" they asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> He replied, "As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> and say to the owner of the house,`The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> He will show you a large upper room, all furnished. Make preparations there."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And he said to them, "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfilment in the kingdom of God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, "Take this and divide it among you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> For I tell you I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed, but woe to that man who betrays him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Also a dispute arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Jesus said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> You are those who have stood by me in my trials.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> "Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift you as wheat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> But he replied, "Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Jesus answered, "I tell you, Peter, before the cock crows today, you will deny three times that you know me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?" "Nothing," they answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> He said to them, "But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> It is written:`And he was numbered with the transgressors'; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfilment."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> The disciples said, "See, Lord, here are two swords." "That is enough," he replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> On reaching the place, he said to them, "Pray that you will not fall into temptation."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> He withdrew about a stone's throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> "Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> "Why are you sleeping?" he asked them. "Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> but Jesus asked him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> When Jesus' followers saw what was going to happen, they said, "Lord, should we strike with our swords?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> But Jesus answered, "No more of this!" And he touched the man's ear and healed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, "Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour--when darkness reigns."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55"> But when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56"> A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, "This man was with him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57"> But he denied it. "Woman, I don't know him," he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58"> A little later someone else saw him and said, "You also are one of them." "Man, I am not!" Peter replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59"> About an hour later another asserted, "Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60"> Peter replied, "Man, I don't know what you're talking about!" Just as he was speaking, the cock crowed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61"> The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: "Before the cock crows today, you will disown me three times."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62"> And he went outside and wept bitterly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63"> The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64"> They blindfolded him and demanded, "Prophesy! Who hit you?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65"> And they said many other insulting things to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66"> At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67"> "If you are the Christ," they said, "tell us." Jesus answered, "If I tell you, you will not believe me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="68"> and if I asked you, you would not answer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="69"> But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="70"> They all asked, "Are you then the Son of God?" He replied, "You are right in saying I am."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="71"> Then they said, "Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Then the whole assembly rose and led him off to Pilate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And they began to accuse him, saying, "We have found this man subverting our nation. He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar and claims to be Christ, a king."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> So Pilate asked Jesus, "Are you the king of the Jews?" "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Then Pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd, "I find no basis for a charge against this man."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> But they insisted, "He stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the way here."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> When he learned that Jesus was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he hoped to see him perform some miracle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> He plied him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there, vehemently accusing him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in an elegant robe, they sent him back to Pilate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> That day Herod and Pilate became friends--before this they had been enemies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers and the people,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> and said to them, "You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for your charges against him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us; as you can see, he has done nothing to deserve death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Therefore, I will punish him and then release him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> With one voice they cried out, "Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> (Barabbas had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> But they kept shouting, "Crucify him! Crucify him!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> For the third time he spoke to them: "Why? What crime has this man committed? I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have him punished and then release him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> But with loud shouts they insistently demanded that he be crucified, and their shouts prevailed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> So Pilate decided to grant their demand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for, and surrendered Jesus to their will.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> As they led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Jesus turned and said to them, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> For the time will come when you will say,`Blessed are the barren women, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Then "`they will say to the mountains, "Fall on us!" and to the hills "Cover us!"' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> For if men do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Two other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be executed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> When they came to the place called the Skull, there they crucified him, along with the criminals--one on his right, the other on his left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him. They said, "He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> and said, "If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> There was a written notice above him, which read: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: "Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> But the other criminal rebuked him. "Don't you fear God," he said, "since you are under the same sentence?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> Jesus answered him, "I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> for the sun stopped shining. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> Jesus called out with a loud voice, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit." When he had said this, he breathed his last.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> The centurion, seeing what had happened, praised God and said, "Surely this was a righteous man."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, they beat their breasts and went away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> But all those who knew him, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> who had not consented to their decision and action. He came from the Judean town of Arimathea and he was waiting for the kingdom of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock, one in which no-one had yet been laid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55"> The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56"> Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="24">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, "Why do you look for the living among the dead?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> `The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Then they remembered his words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> but they were kept from recognising him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> He asked them, "What are you discussing together as you walk along?" They stood still, their faces downcast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, "Are you only a visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> "What things?" he asked. "About Jesus of Nazareth," they replied. "He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> but didn't find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> He said to them, "How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going further.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> But they urged him strongly, "Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over." So he went in to stay with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Then their eyes were opened and they recognised him, and he disappeared from their sight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> They asked each other, "Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> and saying, "It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognised by them when he broke the bread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, "Peace be with you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> He said to them, "Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> They gave him a piece of broiled fish,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> and he took it and ate it in their presence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> He said to them, "This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> He told them, "This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> You are witnesses of these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> Then they worshipped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God.</VERS>

	<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="43" bname="John">
		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> He was with God in the beginning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> In him was life, and that life was the light of men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognise him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> John testifies concerning him. He cries out, saying, "This was he of whom I said,`He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> From the fulness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> No-one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only, who is at the Father's side, has made him known.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, "I am not the Christ." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> They asked him, "Then who are you? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the Prophet?" He answered, "No."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Finally they said, "Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, "I am the voice of one calling in the desert,`Make straight the way for the Lord.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Now some Pharisees who had been sent</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> questioned him, "Why then do you baptise if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> "I baptise with water," John replied, "but among you stands one you do not know.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptising.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him and said, "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> This is the one I meant when I said,`A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptising with water was that he might be revealed to Israel."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Then John gave this testimony: "I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptise with water told me,`The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptise with the Holy Spirit.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> The next day John was there again with two of his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, "Look, the Lamb of God!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Turning round, Jesus saw them following and asked, "What do you want?" They said, "Rabbi" (which means Teacher), "where are you staying?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> "Come," he replied, "and you will see." So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, "We have found the Messiah" (that is, the Christ).</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas" (which, when translated, is Peter). </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, "Follow me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> Philip found Nathanael and told him, "We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> "Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?" Nathanael asked. "Come and see," said Philip.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, "Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> "How do you know me?" Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, "I saw you while you were still under the fig-tree before Philip called you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> Then Nathanael declared, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> Jesus said, "You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig-tree. You shall see greater things than that."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> He then added, "I tell you the truth, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> When the wine was gone, Jesus' mother said to him, "They have no more wine."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> "Dear woman, why do you involve me?" Jesus replied. "My time has not yet come."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> His mother said to the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Jesus said to the servants, "Fill the jars with water"; so they filled them to the brim.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Then he told them, "Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet." They did so,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realise where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> and said, "Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> This, the first of his miraculous signs, Jesus performed at Cana in Galilee. He thus revealed his glory, and his disciples put their faith in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples. There they stayed for a few days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> In the temple courts he found men selling cattle, sheep and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple area, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> To those who sold doves he said, "Get these out of here! How dare you turn my Father's house into a market!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> His disciples remembered that it is written: "Zeal for your house will consume me." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Then the Jews demanded of him, "What miraculous sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> The Jews replied, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> But the temple he had spoken of was his body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said. Then they believed the Scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many people saw the miraculous signs he was doing and believed in his name. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> He did not need man's testimony about man, for he knew what was in a man.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> He came to Jesus at night and said, "Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God. For no-one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> In reply Jesus declared, "I tell you the truth, no-one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> "How can a man be born when he is old?" Nicodemus asked. "Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb to be born!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, no-one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> You should not be surprised at my saying,`You must be born again.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> "How can this be?" Nicodemus asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> "You are Israel's teacher," said Jesus, "and do you not understand these things?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> No-one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven--the Son of Man. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Now John also was baptising at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were constantly coming to be baptised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> (This was before John was put in prison.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> They came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan--the one you testified about--well, he is baptising, and everyone is going to him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> To this John replied, "A man can receive only what is given him from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> You yourselves can testify that I said,`I am not the Christ but am sent ahead of him.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> He must become greater; I must become less.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> "The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no-one accepts his testimony.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him." </VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> The Pharisees heard that Jesus was gaining and baptising more disciples than John,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> although in fact it was not Jesus who baptised, but his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> When the Lord learned of this, he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Now he had to go through Samaria.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, "Will you give me a drink?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> (His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> The Samaritan woman said to him, "You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?" (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.) </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> "Sir," the woman said, "you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his flocks and herds?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Jesus answered, "Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water so that I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> He told her, "Go, call your husband and come back."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> "I have no husband," she replied. Jesus said to her, "You are right when you say you have no husband.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> "Sir," the woman said, "I can see that you are a prophet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Our fathers worshipped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Jesus declared, "Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshippers the Father seeks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> God is spirit, and his worshippers must worship in spirit and in truth."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> The woman said, "I know that Messiah" (called Christ) "is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Then Jesus declared, "I who speak to you am he."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no-one asked, "What do you want?" or "Why are you talking with her?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> "Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?" </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> They came out of the town and made their way towards him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Meanwhile his disciples urged him, "Rabbi, eat something."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> But he said to them, "I have food to eat that you know nothing about."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> Then his disciples said to each other, "Could someone have brought him food?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> "My food," said Jesus, "is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Do you not say,`Four months more and then the harvest'? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Even now the reaper draws his wages, even now he harvests the crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Thus the saying`One sows and another reaps' is true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labour."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, "He told me everything I ever did."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> And because of his words many more became believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> They said to the woman, "We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Saviour of the world."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> After the two days he left for Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> (Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honour in his own country.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, for they also had been there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> "Unless you people see miraculous signs and wonders," Jesus told him, "you will never believe."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> The royal official said, "Sir, come down before my child dies."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> Jesus replied, "You may go. Your son will live." The man took Jesus at his word and departed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> When he enquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, "The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> Then the father realised that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, "Your son will live." So he and all his household believed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> This was the second miraculous sign that Jesus performed, having come from Judea to Galilee.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Here a great number of disabled people used to lie--the blind, the lame, the paralysed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, "Do you want to get well?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> "Sir," the invalid replied, "I have no-one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Then Jesus said to him, "Get up! Pick up your mat and walk."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a Sabbath,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> and so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, "It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> But he replied, "The man who made me well said to me,`Pick up your mat and walk.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> So they asked him, "Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, "See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews persecuted him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Jesus said to them, "My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Jesus gave them this answer: "I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, to your amazement he will show him even greater things than these.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Moreover, the Father judges no-one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> that all may honour the Son just as they honour the Father. He who does not honour the Son does not honour the Father, who sent him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> "I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> I tell you the truth, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> "Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> and come out--those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> "If I testify about myself, my testimony is not valid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> There is another who testifies in my favour, and I know that his testimony about me is valid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> "You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> "I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the very work that the Father has given me to finish, and which I am doing, testifies that the Father has sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> You diligently study the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the Scriptures that testify about me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> yet you refuse to come to me to have life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> "I do not accept praise from men,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> How can you believe if you accept praise from one another, yet make no effort to obtain the praise that comes from the only God? </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> "But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?"</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Some time after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias),</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the miraculous signs he had performed on the sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> The Jewish Passover Feast was near.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming towards him, he said to Philip, "Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Philip answered him, "Eight months' wages would not buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> "Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Jesus said, "Make the people sit down." There was plenty of grass in that place, and the men sat down, about five thousand of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, "Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they began to say, "Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> When they had rowed three or three and a half miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water; and they were terrified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> But he said to them, "It is I; don't be afraid."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realised that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Once the crowd realised that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, "Rabbi, when did you get here?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, you are looking for me, not because you saw miraculous signs but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. On him God the Father has placed his seal of approval."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Then they asked him, "What must we do to do the works God requires?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Jesus answered, "The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> So they asked him, "What miraculous sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Our forefathers ate the manna in the desert; as it is written:`He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> "Sir," they said, "from now on give us this bread."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Then Jesus declared, "I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all that he has given me, but raise them up at the last day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> At this the Jews began to grumble about him because he said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> They said, "Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say,`I came down from heaven'?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> "Stop grumbling among yourselves," Jesus answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> "No-one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> It is written in the Prophets:`They will all be taught by God.' Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> No-one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> I tell you the truth, he who believes has everlasting life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> I am the bread of life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> Your forefathers ate the manna in the desert, yet they died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which a man may eat and not die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live for ever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55"> For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56"> Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57"> Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58"> This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your forefathers ate manna and died, but he who feeds on this bread will live for ever."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59"> He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60"> On hearing it, many of his disciples said, "This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61"> Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, "Does this offend you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62"> What if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63"> The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64"> Yet there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65"> He went on to say, "This is why I told you that no-one can come to me unless the Father has enabled him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66"> From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67"> "You do not want to leave too, do you?" Jesus asked the Twelve.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="68"> Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="69"> We believe and know that you are the Holy One of God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="70"> Then Jesus replied, "Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="71"> (He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray him.)</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> After this, Jesus went around in Galilee, purposely staying away from Judea because the Jews there were waiting to take his life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> But when the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Jesus' brothers said to him, "You ought to leave here and go to Judea, so that your disciples may see the miracles you do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> No-one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret. Since you are doing these things, show yourself to the world."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> For even his own brothers did not believe in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Therefore Jesus told them, "The right time for me has not yet come; for you any time is right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify that what it does is evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> You go to the Feast. I am not yet going up to this Feast, because for me the right time has not yet come."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Having said this, he stayed in Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> However, after his brothers had left for the Feast, he went also, not publicly, but in secret.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Now at the Feast the Jews were watching for him and asking, "Where is that man?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Among the crowds there was widespread whispering about him. Some said, "He is a good man." Others replied, "No, he deceives the people."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> But no-one would say anything publicly about him for fear of the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Not until halfway through the Feast did Jesus go up to the temple courts and begin to teach.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> The Jews were amazed and asked, "How did this man get such learning without having studied?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Jesus answered, "My teaching is not my own. It comes from him who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> If anyone chooses to do God's will, he will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> He who speaks on his own does so to gain honour for himself, but he who works for the honour of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law. Why are you trying to kill me?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> "You are demon-possessed," the crowd answered. "Who is trying to kill you?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Jesus said to them, "I did one miracle, and you are all astonished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Yet, because Moses gave you circumcision (though actually it did not come from Moses, but from the patriarchs), you circumcise a child on the Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Now if a child can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, why are you angry with me for healing the whole man on the Sabbath?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Stop judging by mere appearances, and make a right judgment."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> At that point some of the people of Jerusalem began to ask, "Isn't this the man they are trying to kill?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Here he is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying a word to him. Have the authorities really concluded that he is the Christ? </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> But we know where this man is from; when the Christ comes, no-one will know where he is from."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, "Yes, you know me, and you know where I am from. I am not here on my own, but he who sent me is true. You do not know him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> but I know him because I am from him and he sent me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> At this they tried to seize him, but no-one laid a hand on him, because his time had not yet come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Still, many in the crowd put their faith in him. They said, "When the Christ comes, will he do more miraculous signs than this man?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> Jesus said, "I am with you for only a short time, and then I go to the one who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> You will look for me, but you will not find me; and where I am, you cannot come."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> The Jews said to one another, "Where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him? Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> What did he mean when he said,`You will look for me, but you will not find me,' and`Where I am, you cannot come'?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> On the last and greatest day of the Feast, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> On hearing his words, some of the people said, "Surely this man is the Prophet."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> Others said, "He is the Christ." Still others asked, "How can the Christ come from Galilee?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> Does not the Scripture say that the Christ will come from David's family and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> Thus the people were divided because of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> Some wanted to seize him, but no-one laid a hand on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> Finally the temple guards went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, "Why didn't you bring him in?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> "No-one ever spoke the way this man does," the guards declared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> "You mean he has deceived you also?" the Pharisees retorted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> "Has any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> No! But this mob that knows nothing of the law--there is a curse on them."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number, asked,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> "Does our law condemn a man without first hearing him to find out what he is doing?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> They replied, "Are you from Galilee, too? Look into it, and you will find that a prophet does not come out of Galilee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> Then each went to his own home.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered round him, and he sat down to teach them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> and said to Jesus, "Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, "If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Jesus straightened up and asked her, "Woman, where are they? Has no-one condemned you?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> "No-one, sir," she said. "Then neither do I condemn you," Jesus declared. "Go now and leave your life of sin."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> The Pharisees challenged him, "Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Jesus answered, "Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no-one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> But if I do judge, my decisions are right, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father, who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Then they asked him, "Where is your father?" "You do not know me or my Father," Jesus replied. "If you knew me, you would know my Father also."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> He spoke these words while teaching in the temple area near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no-one seized him, because his time had not yet come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Once more Jesus said to them, "I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> This made the Jews ask, "Will he kill himself? Is that why he says,`Where I go, you cannot come'?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> But he continued, "You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am [the one I claim to be], you will indeed die in your sins."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> "Who are you?" they asked. "Just what I have been claiming all along," Jesus replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> "I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is reliable, and what I have heard from him I tell the world."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> So Jesus said, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am [the one I claim to be] and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Even as he spoke, many put their faith in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, "If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> They answered him, "We are Abraham's descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it for ever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> I know you are Abraham's descendants. Yet you are ready to kill me, because you have no room for my word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> I am telling you what I have seen in the Father's presence, and you do what you have heard from your father." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> "Abraham is our father," they answered. "If you were Abraham's children," said Jesus, "then you would do the things Abraham did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> As it is, you are determined to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> You are doing the things your own father does." "We are not illegitimate children," they protested. "The only Father we have is God himself."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and now am here. I have not come on my own; but he sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don't you believe me?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> He who belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> The Jews answered him, "Aren't we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> "I am not possessed by a demon," said Jesus, "but I honour my Father and you dishonour me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> I tell you the truth, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> At this the Jews exclaimed, "Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that if anyone keeps your word, he will never taste death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> Jesus replied, "If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55"> Though you do not know him, I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and keep his word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56"> Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57"> "You are not yet fifty years old," the Jews said to him, "and you have seen Abraham!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58"> "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59"> At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> "Neither this man nor his parents sinned," said Jesus, "but this happened so that the work of God might be displayed in his life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> As long as it is day, we must do the work of him who sent me. Night is coming, when no-one can work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Having said this, he spat on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man's eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> "Go," he told him, "wash in the Pool of Siloam" (this word means Sent). So the man went and washed, and came home seeing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> His neighbours and those who had formerly seen him begging asked, "Isn't this the same man who used to sit and beg?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Some claimed that he was. Others said, "No, he only looks like him." But he himself insisted, "I am the man."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> "How then were your eyes opened?" they demanded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> He replied, "The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> "Where is this man?" they asked him. "I don't know," he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man's eyes was a Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. "He put mud on my eyes," the man replied, "and I washed, and now I see."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath." But others asked, "How can a sinner do such miraculous signs?" So they were divided.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Finally they turned again to the blind man, "What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened." The man replied, "He is a prophet."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> The Jews still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man's parents.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> "Is this your son?" they asked. "Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> "We know he is our son," the parents answered, "and we know he was born blind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don't know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for already the Jews had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ would be put out of the synagogue.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> That was why his parents said, "He is of age; ask him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. "Give glory to God," they said. "We know this man is a sinner."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> He replied, "Whether he is a sinner or not, I don't know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Then they asked him, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> He answered, "I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples, too?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Then they hurled insults at him and said, "You are this fellow's disciple! We are disciples of Moses!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don't even know where he comes from."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> The man answered, "Now that is remarkable! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly man who does his will.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> To this they replied, "You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!" And they threw him out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> "Who is he, sir?" the man asked. "Tell me so that I may believe in him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Jesus said, "You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Then the man said, "Lord, I believe," and he worshipped him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> Jesus said, "For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, "What? Are we blind too?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> Jesus said, "If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> "I tell you the truth, the man who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a robber.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> The man who enters by the gate is the shepherd of his sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> The watchman opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognise a stranger's voice."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Jesus used this figure of speech, but they did not understand what he was telling them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Therefore Jesus said again, "I tell you the truth, I am the gate for the sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> All who ever came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. He will come in and go out, and find pasture.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> The hired hand is not the shepherd who owns the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> "I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> just as the Father knows me and I know the Father--and I lay down my life for the sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life-- only to take it up again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> No-one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> At these words the Jews were again divided.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Many of them said, "He is demon-possessed and raving mad. Why listen to him?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> But others said, "These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Then came the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> and Jesus was in the temple area walking in Solomon's Colonnade.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> The Jews gathered round him, saying, "How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Jesus answered, "I did tell you, but you do not believe. The miracles I do in my Father's name speak for me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> but you do not believe because you are not my sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no-one can snatch them out of my hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no-one can snatch them out of my Father's hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> I and the Father are one."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Again the Jews picked up stones to stone him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> but Jesus said to them, "I have shown you many great miracles from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> "We are not stoning you for any of these," replied the Jews, "but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your Law,`I have said you are gods'?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> If he called them`gods', to whom the word of God came-- and the Scripture cannot be broken--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said,`I am God's Son'?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Do not believe me unless I do what my Father does.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> But if I do it, even though you do not believe me, believe the miracles, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped their grasp.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptising in the early days. Here he stayed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> and many people came to him. They said, "Though John never performed a miraculous sign, all that John said about this man was true."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> And in that place many believed in Jesus.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> So the sisters sent word to Jesus, "Lord, the one you love is sick."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> When he heard this, Jesus said, "This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for God's glory so that God's Son may be glorified through it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Yet when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Then he said to his disciples, "Let us go back to Judea."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> "But Rabbi," they said, "a short while ago the Jews tried to stone you, and yet you are going back there?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours of daylight? A man who walks by day will not stumble, for he sees by this world's light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> It is when he walks by night that he stumbles, for he has no light."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> After he had said this, he went on to tell them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going there to wake him up."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> His disciples replied, "Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Jesus had been speaking of his death, but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> So then he told them plainly, "Lazarus is dead,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Then Thomas (called Didymus) said to the rest of the disciples, "Let us also go, that we may die with him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> On his arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> "Lord," Martha said to Jesus, "if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Martha answered, "I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> "Yes, Lord," she told him, "I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> And after she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. "The Teacher is here," she said, "and is asking for you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> "Where have you laid him?" he asked. "Come and see, Lord," they replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Jesus wept.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Then the Jews said, "See how he loved him!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> But some of them said, "Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> "Take away the stone," he said. "But, Lord," said Martha, the sister of the dead man, "by this time there is a bad odour, for he has been there four days."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> Then Jesus said, "Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, "Father, I thank you that you have heard me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, "Take off the grave clothes and let him go."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. "What are we accomplishing?" they asked. "Here is this man performing many miraculous signs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, "You know nothing at all!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> You do not realise that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> So from that day on they plotted to take his life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the Jews. Instead he withdrew to a region near the desert, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55"> When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56"> They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple area they asked one another, "What do you think? Isn't he coming to the Feast at all?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57"> But the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone found out where Jesus was, he should report it so that they might arrest him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Six days before the Passover, Jesus arrived at Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Here a dinner was given in Jesus' honour. Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Then Mary took about a pint of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus' feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> "Why wasn't this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year's wages." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> "Leave her alone," Jesus replied. "[It was intended] that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and putting their faith in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> The next day the great crowd that had come for the Feast heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, "Hosanna!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" "Blessed is the King of Israel!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> "Do not be afraid, O Daughter of Zion; see, your king is coming, seated on a donkey's colt." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realise that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Many people, because they had heard that he had given this miraculous sign, went out to meet him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> So the Pharisees said to one another, "See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. "Sir," they said, "we would like to see Jesus."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Jesus replied, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> I tell you the truth, unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="28"> Father, glorify your name!" Then a voice came from heaven, "I have glorified it, and will glorify it again."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Jesus said, "This voice was for your benefit, not mine.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> But I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> The crowd spoke up, "We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain for ever, so how can you say,`The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this`Son of Man'?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Then Jesus told them, "You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. The man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Put your trust in the light while you have it, so that you may become sons of light." When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Even after Jesus had done all these miraculous signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> This was to fulfil the word of Isaiah the prophet: "Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?" </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> "He has blinded their eyes and deadened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn--and I would heal them." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not confess their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> for they loved praise from men more than praise from God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> Then Jesus cried out, "When a man believes in me, he does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> When he looks at me, he sees the one who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> I have come into the world as a light, so that no-one who believes in me should stay in darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> "As for the person who hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; that very word which I spoke will condemn him at the last day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> For I did not speak of my own accord, but the Father who sent me commanded me what to say and how to say it.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> It was just before the Passover Feast. Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> The evening meal was being served, and the devil had already prompted Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, to betray Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel round his waist.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped round him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Jesus replied, "You do not realise now what I am doing, but later you will understand."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> "No," said Peter, "you shall never wash my feet." Jesus answered, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> "Then, Lord," Simon Peter replied, "not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Jesus answered, "A person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet; his whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. "Do you understand what I have done for you?" he asked them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> "You call me`Teacher' and`Lord', and rightly so, for that is what I am.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="20"> I tell you the truth, whoever accepts anyone I send accepts me; and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> After he had said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified, "I tell you the truth, one of you is going to betray me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> His disciples stared at one another, at a loss to know which of them he meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, "Ask him which one he means."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Leaning back against Jesus, he asked him, "Lord, who is it?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Jesus answered, "It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish." Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, son of Simon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him. "What you are about to do, do quickly," Jesus told him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> but no-one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the Feast, or to give something to the poor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out. And it was night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> When he was gone, Jesus said, "Now is the Son of Man glorified and God is glorified in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> If God is glorified in him, God will glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify him at once.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> "My children, I will be with you only a little longer. You will look for me, and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now: Where I am going, you cannot come.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="37"> Peter asked, "Lord, why can't I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="15"> Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest's courtyard,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> but Peter had to wait outside at the door. The other disciple, who was known to the high priest, came back, spoke to the girl on duty there and brought Peter in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> "You are not one of his disciples, are you?" the girl at the door asked Peter. He replied, "I am not."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> It was cold, and the servants and officials stood round a fire they had made to keep warm. Peter also was standing with them, warming himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> "I have spoken openly to the world," Jesus replied. "I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> When Jesus said this, one of the officials near by struck him in the face. "Is this the way you answer the high priest?" he demanded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> "If I said something wrong," Jesus replied, "testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Then Annas sent him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> As Simon Peter stood warming himself, he was asked, "You are not one of his disciples, are you?" He denied it, saying, "I am not."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, "Didn't I see you with him in the olive grove?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a cock began to crow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Then the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness the Jews did not enter the palace; they wanted to be able to eat the Passover.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> So Pilate came out to them and asked, "What charges are you bringing against this man?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> "If he were not a criminal," they replied, "we would not have handed him over to you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Pilate said, "Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law." "But we have no right to execute anyone," the Jews objected.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken indicating the kind of death he was going to die would be fulfilled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> "Is that your own idea," Jesus asked, "or did others talk to you about me?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> "Am I a Jew?" Pilate replied. "It was your people and your chief priests who handed you over to me. What is it you have done?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews. But now my kingdom is from another place."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> "You are a king, then!" said Pilate. Jesus answered, "You are right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> "What is truth?" Pilate asked. With this he went out again to the Jews and said, "I find no basis for a charge against him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release`the king of the Jews'?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> They shouted back, "No, not him! Give us Barabbas!" Now Barabbas had taken part in a rebellion.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> and went up to him again and again, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!" And they struck him in the face.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews, "Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, "Here is the man!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, "Crucify! Crucify!" But Pilate answered, "You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> The Jews insisted, "We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> and he went back inside the palace. "Where do you come from?" he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> "Do you refuse to speak to me?" Pilate said. "Don't you realise I have power either to free you or to crucify you?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Jesus answered, "You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jews kept shouting, "If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha).</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> It was the day of Preparation of Passover Week, about the sixth hour. "Here is your king," Pilate said to the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> But they shouted, "Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!" "Shall I crucify your king?" Pilate asked. "We have no king but Caesar," the chief priests answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified. So the soldiers took charge of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha).</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Here they crucified him, and with him two others--one on each side and Jesus in the middle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, "Do not write`The King of the Jews', but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> "Let's not tear it," they said to one another. "Let's decide by lot who will get it." This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled which said, "They divided my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing." So this is what the soldiers did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing near by, he said to his mother, "Dear woman, here is your son,"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> and to the disciple, "Here is your mother." From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Later, knowing that all was now completed, and so that the Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, "I am thirsty."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus' lips.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> When he had received the drink, Jesus said, "It is finished." With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jews did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: "Not one of his bones will be broken," </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> and, as another scripture says, "They will look on the one they have pierced." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jews. With Pilate's permission, he came and took the body away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> Taking Jesus' body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no-one had ever been laid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was near by, they laid Jesus there.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Both were running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Then Simon Peter, who was behind him, arrived and went into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> as well as the burial cloth that had been around Jesus' head. The cloth was folded up by itself, separate from the linen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Finally the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> (They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Then the disciples went back to their homes,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> but Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> and saw two angels in white, seated where Jesus' body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> They asked her, "Woman, why are you crying?" "They have taken my Lord away," she said, "and I don't know where they have put him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> At this, she turned round and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realise that it was Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> "Woman," he said, "why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?" Thinking he was the gardener, she said, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned towards him and cried out in Aramaic, "Rabboni!" (which means Teacher).</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Jesus said, "Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet returned to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them,`I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: "I have seen the Lord!" And she told them that he had said these things to her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Again Jesus said, "Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And with that he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Now Thomas (called Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> So the other disciples told him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he said to them, "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Thomas said to him, "My Lord and my God!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Then Jesus told him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Afterwards Jesus appeared again to his disciples, by the Sea of Tiberias. It happened this way:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> "I'm going out to fish," Simon Peter told them, and they said, "We'll go with you." So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realise that it was Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> He called out to them, "Friends, haven't you any fish?" "No," they answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> He said, "Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some." When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, "It is the Lord," he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish you have just caught."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Simon Peter climbed aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Jesus said to them, "Come and have breakfast." None of the disciples dared ask him, "Who are you?" They knew it was the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon son of John, do you truly love me more than these?" "Yes, Lord," he said, "you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my lambs."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Again Jesus said, "Simon son of John, do you truly love me?" He answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Take care of my sheep."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> The third time he said to him, "Simon son of John, do you love me?" Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, "Do you love me?" He said, "Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> I tell you the truth, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, "Follow me!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, "Lord, who is going to betray you?")</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> When Peter saw him, he asked, "Lord, what about him?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Jesus answered, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Because of this, the rumour spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
	</BIBLEBOOK>
	<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="44" bname="Acts">
		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> After his suffering, he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: "Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> For John baptised with water, but in a few days you will be baptised with the Holy Spirit."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> So when they met together, they asked him, "Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> He said to them: "It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> "Men of Galilee," they said, "why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Then they returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of Olives, a Sabbath day's walk from the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> When they arrived, they went upstairs to the room where they were staying. Those present were Peter, John, James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew; James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> In those days Peter stood up among the believers (a group numbering about a hundred and twenty)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> and said, "Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who served as guide for those who arrested Jesus--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> he was one of our number and shared in this ministry."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> (With the reward he got for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> "For," said Peter, "it is written in the Book of Psalms, "`May his place be deserted; let there be no-one to dwell in it,' and, "`May another take his place of leadership.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> beginning from John's baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> So they proposed two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Then they prayed, "Lord, you know everyone's heart. Show us which of these two you have chosen</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> to take over this apostolic ministry, which Judas left to go where he belongs."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Then they cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; so he was added to the eleven apostles.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard them speaking in his own language.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Utterly amazed, they asked: "Are not all these men who are speaking Galileans?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Then how is it that each of us hears them in his own native language?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> (both Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs-- we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, "What does this mean?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Some, however, made fun of them and said, "They have had too much wine." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd: "Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> These men are not drunk, as you suppose. It's only nine in the morning!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> "`In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> I will show wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and billows of smoke.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> "Men of Israel, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> This man was handed over to you by God's set purpose and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> David said about him: "`I saw the Lord always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will live in hope,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> because you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your Holy One see decay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence.' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> "Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Seeing what was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to the grave, nor did his body see decay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the fact.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, "`The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> "Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, "Brothers, what shall we do?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Peter replied, "Repent and be baptised, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off--for all whom the Lord our God will call."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, "Save yourselves from this corrupt generation."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> Those who accepted his message were baptised, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> All the believers were together and had everything in common.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> praising God and enjoying the favour of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer--at three in the afternoon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Now a man crippled from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, "Look at us!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Then Peter said, "Silver or gold I do not have, but what I have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man's feet and ankles became strong.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> He jumped to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and jumping, and praising God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> When all the people saw him walking and praising God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> they recognised him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate called Beautiful, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> While the beggar held on to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called Solomon's Colonnade.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> When Peter saw this, he said to them: "Men of Israel, why does this surprise you? Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus. You handed him over to be killed, and you disowned him before Pilate, though he had decided to let him go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> You disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a murderer be released to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the dead. We are witnesses of this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made strong. It is Jesus' name and the faith that comes through him that has given this complete healing to him, as you can all see.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> "Now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your leaders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> But this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, saying that his Christ would suffer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> and that he may send the Christ, who has been appointed for you--even Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> He must remain in heaven until the time comes for God to restore everything, as he promised long ago through his holy prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> For Moses said,`The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people; you must listen to everything he tells you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off from among his people.' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> "Indeed, all the prophets from Samuel on, as many as have spoken, have foretold these days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And you are heirs of the prophets and of the covenant God made with your fathers. He said to Abraham,`Through your offspring all peoples on earth will be blessed.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> The priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to Peter and John while they were speaking to the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> They were greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> They seized Peter and John, and because it was evening, they put them in jail until the next day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> But many who heard the message believed, and the number of men grew to about five thousand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> The next day the rulers, elders and teachers of the law met in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Annas the high priest was there, and so were Caiaphas, John, Alexander and the other men of the high priest's family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them: "By what power or what name did you do this?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them: "Rulers and elders of the people!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a cripple and are asked how he was healed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> then know this, you and all the people of Israel: It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> He is "`the stone you builders rejected, which has become the capstone.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Salvation is found in no-one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realised that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> But since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them, there was nothing they could say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin and then conferred together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> "What are we going to do with these men?" they asked. "Everybody living in Jerusalem knows they have done an outstanding miracle, and we cannot deny it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> But to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people, we must warn these men to speak no longer to anyone in this name."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> But Peter and John replied, "Judge for yourselves whether it is right in God's sight to obey you rather than God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> For we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> After further threats they let them go. They could not decide how to punish them, because all the people were praising God for what had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> For the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> On their release, Peter and John went back to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> When they heard this, they raised their voices together in prayer to God. "Sovereign Lord," they said, "you made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and everything in them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> You spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of your servant, our father David: "`Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the Lord and against his Anointed One.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Indeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel in this city to conspire against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> They did what your power and will had decided beforehand should happen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Stretch out your hand to heal and perform miraculous signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> All the believers were one in heart and mind. No-one claimed that any of his possessions was his own, but they shared everything they had.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and much grace was upon them all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> There were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned lands or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> and put it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to anyone as he had need.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means Son of Encouragement),</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles' feet.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now a man named Ananias, together with his wife Sapphira, also sold a piece of property.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> With his wife's full knowledge he kept back part of the money for himself, but brought the rest and put it at the apostles' feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Then Peter said, "Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Didn't it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn't the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied to men but to God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died. And great fear seized all who heard what had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Then the young men came forward, wrapped up his body, and carried him out and buried him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Peter asked her, "Tell me, is this the price you and Ananias got for the land?" "Yes," she said, "that is the price."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Peter said to her, "How could you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out also."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> At that moment she fell down at his feet and died. Then the young men came in and, finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> The apostles performed many miraculous signs and wonders among the people. And all the believers used to meet together in Solomon's Colonnade.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> No-one else dared join them, even though they were highly regarded by the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Nevertheless, more and more men and women believed in the Lord and were added to their number.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> As a result, people brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that at least Peter's shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Crowds gathered also from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing their sick and those tormented by evil spirits, and all of them were healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Then the high priest and all his associates, who were members of the party of the Sadducees, were filled with jealousy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and brought them out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> "Go, stand in the temple courts," he said, "and tell the people the full message of this new life."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> At daybreak they entered the temple courts, as they had been told, and began to teach the people. When the high priest and his associates arrived, they called together the Sanhedrin-- the full assembly of the elders of Israel--and sent to the jail for the apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> But on arriving at the jail, the officers did not find them there. So they went back and reported,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> "We found the jail securely locked, with the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened them, we found no-one inside."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> On hearing this report, the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests were puzzled, wondering what would come of this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Then someone came and said, "Look! The men you put in jail are standing in the temple courts teaching the people."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> At that, the captain went with his officers and brought the apostles. They did not use force, because they feared that the people would stone them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Having brought the apostles, they made them appear before the Sanhedrin to be questioned by the high priest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> "We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name," he said. "Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man's blood."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Peter and the other apostles replied: "We must obey God rather than men!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> The God of our fathers raised Jesus from the dead--whom you had killed by hanging him on a tree.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Saviour that he might give repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> When they heard this, they were furious and wanted to put them to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honoured by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered that the men be put outside for a little while.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Then he addressed them: "Men of Israel, consider carefully what you intend to do to these men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Some time ago Theudas appeared, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men rallied to him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it all came to nothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> After him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a band of people in revolt. He too was killed, and all his followers were scattered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Therefore, in the present case I advise you: Leave these men alone! Let them go! For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Christ. </VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> In those days when the number of disciples was increasing, the Grecian Jews among them complained against the Hebraic Jews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> So the Twelve gathered all the disciples together and said, "It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God in order to wait on tables.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Brothers, choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will turn this responsibility over to them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> and will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> This proposal pleased the whole group. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit; also Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> They presented these men to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> So the word of God spread. The number of disciples in Jerusalem increased rapidly, and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Now Stephen, a man full of God's grace and power, did great wonders and miraculous signs among the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Opposition arose, however, from members of the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called)--Jews of Cyrene and Alexandria as well as the provinces of Cilicia and Asia. These men began to argue with Stephen,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> but they could not stand up against his wisdom or the Spirit by whom he spoke.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Then they secretly persuaded some men to say, "We have heard Stephen speak words of blasphemy against Moses and against God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> So they stirred up the people and the elders and the teachers of the law. They seized Stephen and brought him before the Sanhedrin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> They produced false witnesses, who testified, "This fellow never stops speaking against this holy place and against the law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs Moses handed down to us."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> All who were sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at Stephen, and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Then the high priest asked him, "Are these charges true?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> To this he replied: "Brothers and fathers, listen to me! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> `Leave your country and your people,' God said,`and go to the land I will show you.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> "So he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. After the death of his father, God sent him to this land where you are now living.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> He gave him no inheritance here, not even a foot of ground. But God promised him that he and his descendants after him would possess the land, even though at that time Abraham had no child.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> God spoke to him in this way:`Your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and ill-treated for four hundred years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves,' God said,`and afterwards they will come out of that country and worship me in this place.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Then he gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision. And Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him eight days after his birth. Later Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> "Because the patriarchs were jealous of Joseph, they sold him as a slave into Egypt. But God was with him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> and rescued him from all his troubles. He gave Joseph wisdom and enabled him to gain the goodwill of Pharaoh king of Egypt; so he made him ruler over Egypt and all his palace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> "Then a famine struck all Egypt and Canaan, bringing great suffering, and our fathers could not find food.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> When Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers on their first visit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> On their second visit, Joseph told his brothers who he was, and Pharaoh learned about Joseph's family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> After this, Joseph sent for his father Jacob and his whole family, seventy-five in all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Then Jacob went down to Egypt, where he and our fathers died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Their bodies were brought back to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor at Shechem for a certain sum of money.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> "As the time drew near for God to fulfil his promise to Abraham, the number of our people in Egypt greatly increased.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Then another king, who knew nothing about Joseph, became ruler of Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> He dealt treacherously with our people and oppressed our forefathers by forcing them to throw out their newborn babies so that they would die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> "At that time Moses was born, and he was no ordinary child. For three months he was cared for in his father's house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> When he was placed outside, Pharaoh's daughter took him and brought him up as her own son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in speech and action.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> "When Moses was forty years old, he decided to visit his fellow Israelites.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> He saw one of them being ill-treated by an Egyptian, so he went to his defence and avenged him by killing the Egyptian.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Moses thought that his own people would realise that God was using him to rescue them, but they did not.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> The next day Moses came upon two Israelites who were fighting. He tried to reconcile them by saying,`Men, you are brothers; why do you want to hurt each other?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> "But the man who was ill-treating the other pushed Moses aside and said,`Who made you ruler and judge over us?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> When Moses heard this, he fled to Midian, where he settled as a foreigner and had two sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> "After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to Moses in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> When he saw this, he was amazed at the sight. As he went over to look more closely, he heard the Lord's voice:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> `I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.' Moses trembled with fear and did not dare to look.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> "Then the Lord said to him,`Take off your sandals; the place where you are standing is holy ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> I have indeed seen the oppression of my people in Egypt. I have heard their groaning and have come down to set them free. Now come, I will send you back to Egypt.' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> "This is the same Moses whom they had rejected with the words,`Who made you ruler and judge?' He was sent to be their ruler and deliverer by God himself, through the angel who appeared to him in the bush.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> He led them out of Egypt and did wonders and miraculous signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea and for forty years in the desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> "This is that Moses who told the Israelites,`God will send you a prophet like me from your own people.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> He was in the assembly in the desert, with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers; and he received living words to pass on to us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> "But our fathers refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> They told Aaron,`Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who led us out of Egypt--we don't know what has happened to him!'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> That was the time they made an idol in the form of a calf. They brought sacrifices to it and held a celebration in honour of what their hands had made.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> But God turned away and gave them over to the worship of the heavenly bodies. This agrees with what is written in the book of the prophets: "`Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings for forty years in the desert, O house of Israel?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> You have lifted up the shrine of Molech and the star of your god Rephan, the idols you made to worship. Therefore I will send you into exile' beyond Babylon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> "Our forefathers had the tabernacle of the Testimony with them in the desert. It had been made as God directed Moses, according to the pattern he had seen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> Having received the tabernacle, our fathers under Joshua brought it with them when they took the land from the nations God drove out before them. It remained in the land until the time of David,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> who enjoyed God's favour and asked that he might provide a dwelling-place for the God of Jacob. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> But it was Solomon who built the house for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> "However, the Most High does not live in houses made by men. As the prophet says:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> "`Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house will you build for me? says the Lord. Or where will my resting place be?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> Has not my hand made all these things?' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> "You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers: You always resist the Holy Spirit!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> Was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> you who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> When they heard this, they were furious and gnashed their teeth at him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55"> But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56"> "Look," he said, "I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57"> At this they covered their ears and, yelling at the top of their voices, they all rushed at him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58"> dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. Meanwhile, the witnesses laid their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59"> While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60"> Then he fell on his knees and cried out, "Lord, do not hold this sin against them." When he had said this, he fell asleep.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> And Saul was there, giving approval to his death. On that day a great persecution broke out against the church at Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off men and women and put them in prison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Christ there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> When the crowds heard Philip and saw the miraculous signs he did, they all paid close attention to what he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> With shrieks, evil spirits came out of many, and many paralytics and cripples were healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> So there was great joy in that city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Now for some time a man named Simon had practised sorcery in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria. He boasted that he was someone great,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> and all the people, both high and low, gave him their attention and exclaimed, "This man is the divine power known as the Great Power."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> They followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his magic.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> But when they believed Philip as he preached the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptised, both men and women.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Simon himself believed and was baptised. And he followed Philip everywhere, astonished by the great signs and miracles he saw.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> When they arrived, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them; they had simply been baptised into the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> When Simon saw that the Spirit was given at the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> and said, "Give me also this ability so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Peter answered: "May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> You have no part or share in this ministry, because your heart is not right before God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord. Perhaps he will forgive you for having such a thought in your heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Then Simon answered, "Pray to the Lord for me so that nothing you have said may happen to me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> When they had testified and proclaimed the word of the Lord, Peter and John returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many Samaritan villages.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, "Go south to the road--the desert road--that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> So he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, an important official in charge of all the treasury of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> and on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the book of Isaiah the prophet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> The Spirit told Philip, "Go to that chariot and stay near it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. "Do you understand what you are reading?" Philip asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> "How can I," he said, "unless someone explains it to me?" So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> The eunuch was reading this passage of Scripture: "He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before the shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> In his humiliation he was deprived of justice. Who can speak of his descendants? For his life was taken from the earth." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> The eunuch asked Philip, "Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> As they travelled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, "Look, here is water. Why shouldn't I be baptised?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptised him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and travelled about, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord's disciples. He went to the high priest</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any there who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> As he neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> "Who are you, Lord?" Saul asked. "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting," he replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> "Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> The men travelling with Saul stood there speechless; they heard the sound but did not see anyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand into Damascus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> For three days he was blind, and did not eat or drink anything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision, "Ananias!" "Yes, Lord," he answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> The Lord told him, "Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> "Lord," Ananias answered, "I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your saints in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> But the Lord said to Ananias, "Go! This man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before the Gentiles and their kings and before the people of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> I will show him how much he must suffer for my name."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord--Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here--has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptised,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> and after taking some food, he regained his strength. Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> At once he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> All those who heard him were astonished and asked, "Isn't he the man who caused havoc in Jerusalem among those who call on this name? And hasn't he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Yet Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Christ. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> After many days had gone by, the Jews conspired to kill him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> but Saul learned of their plan. Day and night they kept close watch on the city gates in order to kill him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> But his followers took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> When he came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> So Saul stayed with them and moved about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> He talked and debated with the Grecian Jews, but they tried to kill him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> When the brothers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace. It was strengthened; and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it grew in numbers, living in the fear of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> As Peter travelled about the country, he went to visit the saints in Lydda.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> There he found a man named Aeneas, a paralytic who had been bedridden for eight years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> "Aeneas," Peter said to him, "Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and tidy up your mat." Immediately Aeneas got up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> All those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (which, when translated, is Dorcas), who was always doing good and helping the poor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> About that time she became sick and died, and her body was washed and placed in an upstairs room.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Lydda was near Joppa; so when the disciples heard that Peter was in Lydda, they sent two men to him and urged him, "Please come at once!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> Peter went with them, and when he arrived he was taken upstairs to the room. All the widows stood around him, crying and showing him the robes and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was still with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> Peter sent them all out of the room; then he got down on his knees and prayed. Turning towards the dead woman, he said, "Tabitha, get up." She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called the believers and the widows and presented her to them alive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> This became known all over Joppa, and many people believed in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> Peter stayed in Joppa for some time with a tanner named Simon.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> He and all his family were devout and God-fearing; he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> One day at about three in the afternoon he had a vision. He distinctly saw an angel of God, who came to him and said, "Cornelius!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Cornelius stared at him in fear. "What is it, Lord?" he asked. The angel answered, "Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> When the angel who spoke to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> He told them everything that had happened and sent them to Joppa.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> About noon the following day as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> He became hungry and wanted something to eat, and while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> It contained all kinds of four-footed animals, as well as reptiles of the earth and birds of the air.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Then a voice told him, "Get up, Peter. Kill and eat."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> "Surely not, Lord!" Peter replied. "I have never eaten anything impure or unclean."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> The voice spoke to him a second time, "Do not call anything impure that God has made clean."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> This happened three times, and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> While Peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision, the men sent by Cornelius found out where Simon's house was and stopped at the gate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> They called out, asking if Simon who was known as Peter was staying there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Simon, three men are looking for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> So get up and go downstairs. Do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Peter went down and said to the men, "I'm the one you're looking for. Why have you come?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> The men replied, "We have come from Cornelius the centurion. He is a righteous and God-fearing man, who is respected by all the Jewish people. A holy angel told him to have you come to his house so that he could hear what you have to say."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Then Peter invited the men into the house to be his guests. The next day Peter started out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa went along.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> The following day he arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> But Peter made him get up. "Stand up," he said, "I am only a man myself."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Talking with him, Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> He said to them: "You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with a Gentile or visit him. But God has shown me that I should not call any man impure or unclean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. May I ask why you sent for me?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Cornelius answered: "Four days ago I was in my house praying at this hour, at three in the afternoon. Suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> and said,`Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Then Peter began to speak: "I now realise how true it is that God does not show favouritism</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> but accepts men from every nation who fear him and do what is right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, telling the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> You know what has happened throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> "We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a tree,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen--by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. Then Peter said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> "Can anyone keep these people from being baptised with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> So he ordered that they be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> The apostles and the brothers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticised him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> and said, "You went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Peter began and explained everything to them precisely as it had happened:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> "I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. I saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to where I was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds of the air.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Then I heard a voice telling me,`Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> "I replied,`Surely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> "The voice spoke from heaven a second time,`Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> This happened three times, and then it was pulled up to heaven again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> "Right then three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> The Spirit told me to have no hesitation about going with them. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man's house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> He told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say,`Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> He will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> "As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them as he had come on us at the beginning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Then I remembered what the Lord had said:`John baptised with water, but you will be baptised with the Holy Spirit.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> So if God gave them the same gift as he gave us, who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could oppose God?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> When they heard this, they had no further objections and praised God, saying, "So then, God has granted even the Gentiles repentance unto life."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Now those who had been scattered by the persecution in connection with Stephen travelled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, telling the message only to Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Some of them, however, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began to speak to Greeks also, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> The Lord's hand was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> News of this reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> When he arrived and saw the evidence of the grace of God, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> During this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. (This happened during the reign of Claudius.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> The disciples, each according to his ability, decided to provide help for the brothers living in Judea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> This they did, sending their gift to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> It was about this time that King Herod arrested some who belonged to the church, intending to persecute them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> He had James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> When he saw that this pleased the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. This happened during the Feast of Unleavened Bread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> After arresting him, he put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the Passover.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> The night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries stood guard at the entrance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him up. "Quick, get up!" he said, and the chains fell off Peter's wrists.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Then the angel said to him, "Put on your clothes and sandals." And Peter did so. "Wrap your cloak around you and follow me," the angel told him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Peter followed him out of the prison, but he had no idea that what the angel was doing was really happening; he thought he was seeing a vision.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city. It opened for them by itself, and they went through it. When they had walked the length of one street, suddenly the angel left him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Then Peter came to himself and said, "Now I know without a doubt that the Lord sent his angel and rescued me from Herod's clutches and from everything the Jewish people were anticipating."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> When this had dawned on him, he went to the house of Mary the mother of John, also called Mark, where many people had gathered and were praying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Peter knocked at the outer entrance, and a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer the door.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> When she recognised Peter's voice, she was so overjoyed she ran back without opening it and exclaimed, "Peter is at the door!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> "You're out of your mind," they told her. When she kept insisting that it was so, they said, "It must be his angel."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> But Peter kept on knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were astonished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Peter motioned with his hand for them to be quiet and described how the Lord had brought him out of prison. "Tell James and the brothers about this," he said, and then he left for another place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> In the morning, there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> After Herod had a thorough search made for him and did not find him, he cross-examined the guards and ordered that they be executed. Then Herod went from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there a while.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> He had been quarrelling with the people of Tyre and Sidon; they now joined together and sought an audience with him. Having secured the support of Blastus, a trusted personal servant of the king, they asked for peace, because they depended on the king's country for their food supply.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> On the appointed day Herod, wearing his royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a public address to the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> They shouted, "This is the voice of a god, not of a man."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Immediately, because Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> But the word of God continued to increase and spread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> When Barnabas and Saul had finished their mission, they returned from Jerusalem, taking with them John, also called Mark.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> In the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch) and Saul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> While they were worshipping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and sent them off.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> The two of them, sent on their way by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia and sailed from there to Cyprus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. John was with them as their helper.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> They travelled through the whole island until they came to Paphos. There they met a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet named Bar-Jesus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> who was an attendant of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus. The proconsul, an intelligent man, sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> But Elymas the sorcerer (for that is what his name means) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul from the faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Then Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked straight at Elymas and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> "You are a child of the devil and an enemy of everything that is right! You are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery. Will you never stop perverting the right ways of the Lord?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Now the hand of the Lord is against you. You are going to be blind, and for a time you will be unable to see the light of the sun." Immediately mist and darkness came over him, and he groped about, seeking someone to lead him by the hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was amazed at the teaching about the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> From Paphos, Paul and his companions sailed to Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them to return to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> From Perga they went on to Pisidian Antioch. On the Sabbath they entered the synagogue and sat down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue rulers sent word to them, saying, "Brothers, if you have a message of encouragement for the people, please speak."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Standing up, Paul motioned with his hand and said: "Men of Israel and you Gentiles who worship God, listen to me!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers; he made the people prosper during their stay in Egypt, with mighty power he led them out of that country,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> he endured their conduct for about forty years in the desert,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> he overthrew seven nations in Canaan and gave their land to his people as their inheritance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> All this took about 450 years. "After this, God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Then the people asked for a king, and he gave them Saul son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, who ruled for forty years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> After removing Saul, he made David their king. He testified concerning him:`I have found David son of Jesse a man after my own heart; he will do everything I want him to do.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> "From this man's descendants God has brought to Israel the Saviour Jesus, as he promised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Before the coming of Jesus, John preached repentance and baptism to all the people of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> As John was completing his work, he said:`Who do you think I am? I am not that one. No, but he is coming after me, whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> "Brothers, children of Abraham, and you God-fearing Gentiles, it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognise Jesus, yet in condemning him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Though they found no proper ground for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have him executed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> When they had carried out all that was written about him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> But God raised him from the dead,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> and for many days he was seen by those who had travelled with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now his witnesses to our people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> "We tell you the good news: What God promised our fathers</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm: "`You are my Son; today I have become your Father.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> The fact that God raised him from the dead, never to decay, is stated in these words: "`I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> So it is stated elsewhere: "`You will not let your Holy One see decay.' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> "For when David had served God's purpose in his own generation, he fell asleep; he was buried with his fathers and his body decayed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> But the one whom God raised from the dead did not see decay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> "Therefore, my brothers, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> Through him everyone who believes is justified from everything you could not be justified from by the law of Moses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> Take care that what the prophets have said does not happen to you:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> "`Look, you scoffers, wonder and perish, for I am going to do something in your days that you would never believe, even if someone told you.'" </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people invited them to speak further about these things on the next Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> When the congregation was dismissed, many of the Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked with them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> On the next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and talked abusively against what Paul was saying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> Then Paul and Barnabas answered them boldly: "We had to speak the word of God to you first. Since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> For this is what the Lord has commanded us: "`I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honoured the word of the Lord; and all who were appointed for eternal life believed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> The word of the Lord spread through the whole region.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> But the Jews incited the God-fearing women of high standing and the leading men of the city. They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their region.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> So they shook the dust from their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> At Iconium Paul and Barnabas went as usual into the Jewish synagogue. There they spoke so effectively that a great number of Jews and Gentiles believed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> So Paul and Barnabas spent considerable time there, speaking boldly for the Lord, who confirmed the message of his grace by enabling them to do miraculous signs and wonders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> The people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews, others with the apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> There was a plot afoot among the Gentiles and Jews, together with their leaders, to ill-treat them and stone them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> But they found out about it and fled to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe and to the surrounding country,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> where they continued to preach the good news.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> In Lystra there sat a man crippled in his feet, who was lame from birth and had never walked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> He listened to Paul as he was speaking. Paul looked directly at him, saw that he had faith to be healed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> and called out, "Stand up on your feet!" At that, the man jumped up and began to walk.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, "The gods have come down to us in human form!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes because he was the chief speaker.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates because he and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of this, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> "Men, why are you doing this? We too are only men, human like you. We are bringing you good news, telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made heaven and earth and sea and everything in them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> In the past, he let all nations go their own way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Yet he has not left himself without testimony: He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons; he provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Even with these words, they had difficulty keeping the crowd from sacrificing to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> But after the disciples had gathered round him, he got up and went back into the city. The next day he and Barnabas left for Derbe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> They preached the good news in that city and won a large number of disciples. Then they returned to Lystra, Iconium and Antioch,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to remain true to the faith. "We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God," they said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Paul and Barnabas appointed elders for them in each church and, with prayer and fasting, committed them to the Lord, in whom they had put their trust.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> After going through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> and when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> From Attalia they sailed back to Antioch, where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work they had now completed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> On arriving there, they gathered the church together and reported all that God had done through them and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> And they stayed there a long time with the disciples.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Some men came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the brothers: "Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom taught by Moses, you cannot be saved."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> This brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul and Barnabas were appointed, along with some other believers, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> The church sent them on their way, and as they travelled through Phoenicia and Samaria, they told how the Gentiles had been converted. This news made all the brothers very glad.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and elders, to whom they reported everything God had done through them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Then some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, "The Gentiles must be circumcised and required to obey the law of Moses."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> The apostles and elders met to consider this question.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them: "Brothers, you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> He made no distinction between us and them, for he purified their hearts by faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of the disciples a yoke that neither we nor our fathers have been able to bear?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> The whole assembly became silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul telling about the miraculous signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> When they finished, James spoke up: "Brothers, listen to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Simon has described to us how God at first showed his concern by taking from the Gentiles a people for himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> The words of the prophets are in agreement with this, as it is written:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> "`After this I will return and rebuild David's fallen tent. Its ruins I will rebuild, and I will restore it,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> that the remnant of men may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles who bear my name, says the Lord, who does these things' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> that have been known for ages. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> "It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> For Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to choose some of their own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas, two men who were leaders among the brothers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> With them they sent the following letter: The apostles and elders, your brothers, To the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia: Greetings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> We have heard that some went out from us without our authorisation and disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. Farewell.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> The men were sent off and went down to Antioch, where they gathered the church together and delivered the letter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> The people read it and were glad for its encouraging message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the brothers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> After spending some time there, they were sent off by the brothers with the blessing of peace to return to those who had sent them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, where they and many others taught and preached the word of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Some time later Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us go back and visit the brothers in all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord and see how they are doing."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> but Paul did not think it wise to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> but Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> He came to Derbe and then to Lystra, where a disciple named Timothy lived, whose mother was a Jewess and a believer, but whose father was a Greek.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> The brothers at Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Paul wanted to take him along on the journey, so he circumcised him because of the Jews who lived in that area, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> As they travelled from town to town, they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Paul and his companions travelled throughout the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been kept by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in the province of Asia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> When they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> During the night Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and begging him, "Come over to Macedonia and help us."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> After Paul had seen the vision, we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> From Troas we put out to sea and sailed straight for Samothrace, and the next day on to Neapolis.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> From there we travelled to Philippi, a Roman colony and the leading city of that district of Macedonia. And we stayed there several days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river, where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> One of those listening was a woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, who was a worshipper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul's message.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> When she and the members of her household were baptised, she invited us to her home. "If you consider me a believer in the Lord," she said, "come and stay at my house." And she persuaded us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Once when we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit by which she predicted the future. She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> This girl followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, "These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> She kept this up for many days. Finally Paul became so troubled that he turned round and said to the spirit, "In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her!" At that moment the spirit left her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> When the owners of the slave girl realised that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the market-place to face the authorities.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> They brought them before the magistrates and said, "These men are Jews, and are throwing our city into an uproar</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practise."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Upon receiving such orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everybody's chains came loose.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> But Paul shouted, "Don't harm yourself! We are all here!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> The jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> He then brought them out and asked, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> They replied, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved--you and your household."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his family were baptised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God--he and his whole family.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> When it was daylight, the magistrates sent their officers to the jailer with the order: "Release those men."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> The jailer told Paul, "The magistrates have ordered that you and Silas be released. Now you can leave. Go in peace."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> But Paul said to the officers: "They beat us publicly without a trial, even though we are Roman citizens, and threw us into prison. And now do they want to get rid of us quietly? No! Let them come themselves and escort us out."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> The officers reported this to the magistrates, and when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were alarmed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> They came to appease them and escorted them from the prison, requesting them to leave the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> After Paul and Silas came out of the prison, they went to Lydia's house, where they met with the brothers and encouraged them. Then they left.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> When they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> As his custom was, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> explaining and proving that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead. "This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Christ," he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks and not a few prominent women.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> But the Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from the market-place, formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They rushed to Jason's house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other brothers before the city officials, shouting: "These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesar's decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> When they heard this, the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Then they put Jason and the others on bail and let them go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> As soon as it was night, the brothers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Many of the Jews believed, as did also a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> When the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Berea, they went there too, agitating the crowds and stirring them up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> The brothers immediately sent Paul to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed at Berea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> The men who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the market-place day by day with those who happened to be there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to dispute with him. Some of them asked, "What is this babbler trying to say?" Others remarked, "He seems to be advocating foreign gods." They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said to him, "May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we want to know what they mean."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> (All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: "Men of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Now what you worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> "The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything, because he himself gives all men life and breath and everything else.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> From one man he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> God did this so that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> `For in him we live and move and have our being.' As some of your own poets have said,`We are his offspring.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> "Therefore since we are God's offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone-- an image made by man's design and skill.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to all men by raising him from the dead."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, "We want to hear you again on this subject."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> At that, Paul left the Council.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> A few men became followers of Paul and believed. Among them was Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a number of others.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> There he met a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to see them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> and because he was a tentmaker as they were, he stayed and worked with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> But when the Jews opposed Paul and became abusive, he shook out his clothes in protest and said to them, "Your blood be on your own heads! I am clear of my responsibility. From now on I will go to the Gentiles."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Then Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titius Justus, a worshipper of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Crispus, the synagogue ruler, and his entire household believed in the Lord; and many of the Corinthians who heard him believed and were baptised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: "Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> For I am with you, and no-one is going to attack and harm you, because I have many people in this city."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> So Paul stayed for a year and a half, teaching them the word of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack on Paul and brought him into court.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> "This man," they charged, "is persuading the people to worship God in ways contrary to the law."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to the Jews, "If you Jews were making a complaint about some misdemeanour or serious crime, it would be reasonable for me to listen to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> But since it involves questions about words and names and your own law--settle the matter yourselves. I will not be a judge of such things."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> So he had them ejected from the court.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Then they all turned on Sosthenes the synagogue ruler and beat him in front of the court. But Gallio showed no concern whatever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Paul stayed on in Corinth for some time. Then he left the brothers and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. Before he sailed, he had his hair cut off at Cenchrea because of a vow he had taken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> They arrived at Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> When they asked him to spend more time with them, he declined.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> But as he left, he promised, "I will come back if it is God's will." Then he set sail from Ephesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> When he landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church and then went down to Antioch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> After spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out from there and travelled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was a learned man, with a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and he spoke with great fervour and taught about Jesus accurately, though he knew only the baptism of John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> When Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. On arriving, he was a great help to those who by grace had believed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> For he vigorously refuted the Jews in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> and asked them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" They answered, "No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> So Paul asked, "Then what baptism did you receive?" "John's baptism," they replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Paul said, "John's baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> On hearing this, they were baptised into the name of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> There were about twelve men in all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> But some of them became obstinate; they refused to believe and publicly maligned the Way. So Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> This went on for two years, so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> God did extraordinary miracles through Paul,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed. They would say, "In the name of Jesus, whom Paul preaches, I command you to come out."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> [One day] the evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know, and I know about Paul, but who are you?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all. He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> When this became known to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, they were all seized with fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honour.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Many of those who believed now came and openly confessed their evil deeds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> A number who had practised sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> After all this had happened, Paul decided to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia. "After I have been there," he said, "I must visit Rome also."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed in the province of Asia a little longer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> About that time there arose a great disturbance about the Way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought in no little business for the craftsmen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> He called them together, along with the workmen in related trades, and said: "Men, you know we receive a good income from this business.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And you see and hear how this fellow Paul has convinced and led astray large numbers of people here in Ephesus and in practically the whole province of Asia. He says that man-made gods are no gods at all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> There is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited, and the goddess herself, who is worshipped throughout the province of Asia and the world, will be robbed of her divine majesty."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> When they heard this, they were furious and began shouting: "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Soon the whole city was in an uproar. The people seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's travelling companions from Macedonia, and rushed as one man into the theatre.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Paul wanted to appear before the crowd, but the disciples would not let him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Even some of the officials of the province, friends of Paul, sent him a message begging him not to venture into the theatre.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> The assembly was in confusion: Some were shouting one thing, some another. Most of the people did not even know why they were there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> The Jews pushed Alexander to the front, and some of the crowd shouted instructions to him. He motioned for silence in order to make a defence before the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> But when they realised he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours: "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> The city clerk quietened the crowd and said: "Men of Ephesus, doesn't all the world know that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image, which fell from heaven?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Therefore, since these facts are undeniable, you ought to be quiet and not do anything rash.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> You have brought these men here, though they have neither robbed temples nor blasphemed our goddess.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> If, then, Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a grievance against anybody, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. They can press charges.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> If there is anything further you want to bring up, it must be settled in a legal assembly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> As it is, we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of today's events. In that case we would not be able to account for this commotion, since there is no reason for it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> When the uproar had ended, Paul sent for the disciples and, after encouraging them, said good-bye and set out for Macedonia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> He travelled through that area, speaking many words of encouragement to the people, and finally arrived in Greece,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> where he stayed three months. Because the Jews made a plot against him just as he was about to sail for Syria, he decided to go back through Macedonia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> He was accompanied by Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy also, and Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> These men went on ahead and waited for us at Troas.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> But we sailed from Philippi after the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and five days later joined the others at Troas, where we stayed seven days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> On the first day of the week we came together to break bread. Paul spoke to the people and, because he intended to leave the next day, kept on talking until midnight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> There were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Seated in a window was a young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep sleep as Paul talked on and on. When he was sound asleep, he fell to the ground from the third storey and was picked up dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Paul went down, threw himself on the young man and put his arms around him. "Don't be alarmed," he said. "He's alive!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Then he went upstairs again and broke bread and ate. After talking until daylight, he left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> The people took the young man home alive and were greatly comforted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> We went on ahead to the ship and sailed for Assos, where we were going to take Paul aboard. He had made this arrangement because he was going there on foot.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> When he met us at Assos, we took him aboard and went on to Mitylene.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> The next day we set sail from there and arrived off Kios. The day after that we crossed over to Samos, and on the following day arrived at Miletus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in the province of Asia, for he was in a hurry to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> From Miletus, Paul sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> When they arrived, he said to them: "You know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day I came into the province of Asia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> I served the Lord with great humility and with tears, although I was severely tested by the plots of the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> You know that I have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to you but have taught you publicly and from house to house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> "And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> I only know that in every city the Holy Spirit warns me that prison and hardships are facing me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> However, I consider my life worth nothing to me, if only I may finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me--the task of testifying to the gospel of God's grace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> "Now I know that none of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will ever see me again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Therefore, I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of all men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> For I have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own blood.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> I know that after I leave, savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Even from your own number men will arise and distort the truth in order to draw away disciples after them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> So be on your guard! Remember that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> "Now I commit you to God and to the word of his grace, which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> I have not coveted anyone's silver or gold or clothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> You yourselves know that these hands of mine have supplied my own needs and the needs of my companions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said:`It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> When he had said this, he knelt down with all of them and prayed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> They all wept as they embraced him and kissed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> What grieved them most was his statement that they would never see his face again. Then they accompanied him to the ship.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> After we had torn ourselves away from them, we put out to sea and sailed straight to Cos. The next day we went to Rhodes and from there to Patara.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> We found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, went on board and set sail.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> After sighting Cyprus and passing to the south of it, we sailed on to Syria. We landed at Tyre, where our ship was to unload its cargo.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Finding the disciples there, we stayed with them seven days. Through the Spirit they urged Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> But when our time was up, we left and continued on our way. All the disciples and their wives and children accompanied us out of the city, and there on the beach we knelt to pray.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> After saying good-bye to each other, we went aboard the ship, and they returned home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> We continued our voyage from Tyre and landed at Ptolemais, where we greeted the brothers and stayed with them for a day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Leaving the next day, we reached Caesarea and stayed at the house of Philip the evangelist, one of the Seven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> After we had been there a number of days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Coming over to us, he took Paul's belt, tied his own hands and feet with it and said, "The Holy Spirit says,`In this way the Jews of Jerusalem will bind the owner of this belt and will hand him over to the Gentiles.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> When we heard this, we and the people there pleaded with Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Then Paul answered, "Why are you weeping and breaking my heart? I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> When he would not be dissuaded, we gave up and said, "The Lord's will be done."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> After this, we got ready and went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Some of the disciples from Caesarea accompanied us and brought us to the home of Mnason, where we were to stay. He was a man from Cyprus and one of the early disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> When we arrived at Jerusalem, the brothers received us warmly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> The next day Paul and the rest of us went to see James, and all the elders were present.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Paul greeted them and reported in detail what God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> When they heard this, they praised God. Then they said to Paul: "You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews have believed, and all of them are zealous for the law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> They have been informed that you teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to turn away from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or live according to our customs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> What shall we do? They will certainly hear that you have come,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> so do what we tell you. There are four men with us who have made a vow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Take these men, join in their purification rites and pay their expenses, so that they can have their heads shaved. Then everybody will know there is no truth in these reports about you, but that you yourself are living in obedience to the law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> As for the Gentile believers, we have written to them our decision that they should abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> The next day Paul took the men and purified himself along with them. Then he went to the temple to give notice of the date when the days of purification would end and the offering would be made for each of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> When the seven days were nearly over, some Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul at the temple. They stirred up the whole crowd and seized him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> shouting, "Men of Israel, help us! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against our people and our law and this place. And besides, he has brought Greeks into the temple area and defiled this holy place."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> (They had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul and assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple area.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> The whole city was aroused, and the people came running from all directions. Seizing Paul, they dragged him from the temple, and immediately the gates were shut.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> While they were trying to kill him, news reached the commander of the Roman troops that the whole city of Jerusalem was in an uproar.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> He at once took some officers and soldiers and ran down to the crowd. When the rioters saw the commander and his soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> The commander came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains. Then he asked who he was and what he had done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Some in the crowd shouted one thing and some another, and since the commander could not get at the truth because of the uproar, he ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> When Paul reached the steps, the violence of the mob was so great he had to be carried by the soldiers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> The crowd that followed kept shouting, "Away with him!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> As the soldiers were about to take Paul into the barracks, he asked the commander, "May I say something to you?" "Do you speak Greek?" he replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> "Aren't you the Egyptian who started a revolt and led four thousand terrorists out into the desert some time ago?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> Paul answered, "I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary city. Please let me speak to the people."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> Having received the commander's permission, Paul stood on the steps and motioned to the crowd. When they were all silent, he said to them in Aramaic: </VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> "Brothers and fathers, listen now to my defence."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> When they heard him speak to them in Aramaic, they became very quiet. Then Paul said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> "I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city. Under Gamaliel I was thoroughly trained in the law of our fathers and was just as zealous for God as any of you are today.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> I persecuted the followers of this Way to their death, arresting both men and women and throwing them into prison,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> as also the high priest and all the Council can testify. I even obtained letters from them to their brothers in Damascus, and went there to bring these people as prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> "About noon as I came near Damascus, suddenly a bright light from heaven flashed around me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me,`Saul! Saul! Why do you persecute me?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> "`Who are you, Lord?' I asked. "`I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting,' he replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> My companions saw the light, but they did not understand the voice of him who was speaking to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> "`What shall I do, Lord?' I asked. "`Get up,' the Lord said,`and go into Damascus. There you will be told all that you have been assigned to do.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> My companions led me by the hand into Damascus, because the brilliance of the light had blinded me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> "A man named Ananias came to see me. He was a devout observer of the law and highly respected by all the Jews living there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> He stood beside me and said,`Brother Saul, receive your sight!' And at that very moment I was able to see him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> "Then he said:`The God of our fathers has chosen you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear words from his mouth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> You will be his witness to all men of what you have seen and heard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptised and wash your sins away, calling on his name.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> "When I returned to Jerusalem and was praying at the temple, I fell into a trance</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> and saw the Lord speaking.`Quick!' he said to me.`Leave Jerusalem immediately, because they will not accept your testimony about me.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> "`Lord,' I replied,`these men know that I went from one synagogue to another to imprison and beat those who believe in you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I stood there giving my approval and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> "Then the Lord said to me,`Go; I will send you far away to the Gentiles.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> The crowd listened to Paul until he said this. Then they raised their voices and shouted, "Rid the earth of him! He's not fit to live!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> As they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> the commander ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks. He directed that he be flogged and questioned in order to find out why the people were shouting at him like this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> As they stretched him out to flog him, Paul said to the centurion standing there, "Is it legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who hasn't even been found guilty?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and reported it. "What are you going to do?" he asked. "This man is a Roman citizen."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> The commander went to Paul and asked, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" "Yes, I am," he answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Then the commander said, "I had to pay a big price for my citizenship." "But I was born a citizen," Paul replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Those who were about to question him withdrew immediately. The commander himself was alarmed when he realised that he had put Paul, a Roman citizen, in chains.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> The next day, since the commander wanted to find out exactly why Paul was being accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to assemble. Then he brought Paul and had him stand before them.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin and said, "My brothers, I have fulfilled my duty to God in all good conscience to this day."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> At this the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Then Paul said to him, "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! You sit there to judge me according to the law, yet you yourself violate the law by commanding that I be struck!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Those who were standing near Paul said, "You dare to insult God's high priest?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Paul replied, "Brothers, I did not realise that he was the high priest; for it is written:`Do not speak evil about the ruler of your people.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Then Paul, knowing that some of them were Sadducees and the others Pharisees, called out in the Sanhedrin, "My brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee. I stand on trial because of my hope in the resurrection of the dead."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> When he said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> (The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, and that there are neither angels nor spirits, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> There was a great uproar, and some of the teachers of the law who were Pharisees stood up and argued vigorously. "We find nothing wrong with this man," they said. "What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> The dispute became so violent that the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them. He ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force and bring him into the barracks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> The following night the Lord stood near Paul and said, "Take courage! As you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> The next morning the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> More than forty men were involved in this plot.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> They went to the chief priests and elders and said, "We have taken a solemn oath not to eat anything until we have killed Paul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Now then, you and the Sanhedrin petition the commander to bring him before you on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about his case. We are ready to kill him before he gets here."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> But when the son of Paul's sister heard of this plot, he went into the barracks and told Paul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, "Take this young man to the commander; he has something to tell him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> So he took him to the commander. The centurion said, "Paul, the prisoner, sent for me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> The commander took the young man by the hand, drew him aside and asked, "What is it you want to tell me?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> He said: "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul before the Sanhedrin tomorrow on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Don't give in to them, because more than forty of them are waiting in ambush for him. They have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. They are ready now, waiting for your consent to their request."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> The commander dismissed the young man and cautioned him, "Don't tell anyone that you have reported this to me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Then he called two of his centurions and ordered them, "Get ready a detachment of two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea at nine tonight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Provide mounts for Paul so that he may be taken safely to Governor Felix."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> He wrote a letter as follows:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Claudius Lysias, To His Excellency, Governor Felix: Greetings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> This man was seized by the Jews and they were about to kill him, but I came with my troops and rescued him, for I had learned that he is a Roman citizen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> I wanted to know why they were accusing him, so I brought him to their Sanhedrin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> I found that the accusation had to do with questions about their law, but there was no charge against him that deserved death or imprisonment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> When I was informed of a plot to be carried out against the man, I sent him to you at once. I also ordered his accusers to present to you their case against him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul with them during the night and brought him as far as Antipatris.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> The next day they let the cavalry go on with him, while they returned to the barracks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> When the cavalry arrived in Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor and handed Paul over to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> The governor read the letter and asked what province he was from. Learning that he was from Cilicia,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> he said, "I will hear your case when your accusers get here." Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod's palace.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="24">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Five days later the high priest Ananias went down to Caesarea with some of the elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, and they brought their charges against Paul before the governor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> When Paul was called in, Tertullus presented his case before Felix: "We have enjoyed a long period of peace under you, and your foresight has brought about reforms in this nation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Everywhere and in every way, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with profound gratitude.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> But in order not to weary you further, I would request that you be kind enough to hear us briefly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> "We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the Nazarene sect</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> and even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> By examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> The Jews joined in the accusation, asserting that these things were true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> When the governor motioned for him to speak, Paul replied: "I know that for a number of years you have been a judge over this nation; so I gladly make my defence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> You can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> My accusers did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple, or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> However, I admit that I worship the God of our fathers as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that agrees with the Law and that is written in the Prophets,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> and I have the same hope in God as these men, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> "After an absence of several years, I came to Jerusalem to bring my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> I was ceremonially clean when they found me in the temple courts doing this. There was no crowd with me, nor was I involved in any disturbance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> But there are some Jews from the province of Asia, who ought to be here before you and bring charges if they have anything against me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Or these who are here should state what crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> unless it was this one thing I shouted as I stood in their presence:`It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Then Felix, who was well acquainted with the Way, adjourned the proceedings. "When Lysias the commander comes," he said, "I will decide your case."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard but to give him some freedom and permit his friends to take care of his needs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Several days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess. He sent for Paul and listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> As Paul discoursed on righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and said, "That's enough for now! You may leave. When I find it convenient, I will send for you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> At the same time he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe, so he sent for him frequently and talked with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> When two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, but because Felix wanted to grant a favour to the Jews, he left Paul in prison.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="25">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Three days after arriving in the province, Festus went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> where the chief priests and Jewish leaders appeared before him and presented the charges against Paul.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> They urgently requested Festus, as a favour to them, to have Paul transferred to Jerusalem, for they were preparing an ambush to kill him along the way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Festus answered, "Paul is being held at Caesarea, and I myself am going there soon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Let some of your leaders come with me and press charges against the man there, if he has done anything wrong."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> After spending eight or ten days with them, he went down to Caesarea, and the next day he convened the court and ordered that Paul be brought before him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> When Paul appeared, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many serious charges against him, which they could not prove.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Then Paul made his defence: "I have done nothing wrong against the law of the Jews or against the temple or against Caesar."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favour, said to Paul, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me there on these charges?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Paul answered: "I am now standing before Caesar's court, where I ought to be tried. I have not done any wrong to the Jews, as you yourself know very well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> If, however, I am guilty of doing anything deserving death, I do not refuse to die. But if the charges brought against me by these Jews are not true, no-one has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> After Festus had conferred with his council, he declared: "You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you will go!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> A few days later King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Since they were spending many days there, Festus discussed Paul's case with the king. He said: "There is a man here whom Felix left as a prisoner.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> When I went to Jerusalem, the chief priests and elders of the Jews brought charges against him and asked that he be condemned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> "I told them that it is not the Roman custom to hand over any man before he has faced his accusers and has had an opportunity to defend himself against their charges.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> When they came here with me, I did not delay the case, but convened the court the next day and ordered the man to be brought in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> When his accusers got up to speak, they did not charge him with any of the crimes I had expected.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Instead, they had some points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a dead man named Jesus whom Paul claimed was alive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> I was at a loss how to investigate such matters; so I asked if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and stand trial there on these charges.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> When Paul made his appeal to be held over for the Emperor's decision, I ordered him to be held until I could send him to Caesar."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Then Agrippa said to Festus, "I would like to hear this man myself." He replied, "Tomorrow you will hear him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> The next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience room with the high ranking officers and the leading men of the city. At the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Festus said: "King Agrippa, and all who are present with us, you see this man! The whole Jewish community has petitioned me about him in Jerusalem and here in Caesarea, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> I found he had done nothing deserving of death, but because he made his appeal to the Emperor I decided to send him to Rome.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> But I have nothing definite to write to His Majesty about him. Therefore I have brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that as a result of this investigation I may have something to write.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> For I think it is unreasonable to send on a prisoner without specifying the charges against him."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="26">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Then Agrippa said to Paul, "You have permission to speak for yourself." So Paul motioned with his hand and began his defence:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> "King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate to stand before you today as I make my defence against all the accusations of the Jews,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> and especially so because you are well acquainted with all the Jewish customs and controversies. Therefore, I beg you to listen to me patiently.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> "The Jews all know the way I have lived ever since I was a child, from the beginning of my life in my own country, and also in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> They have known me for a long time and can testify, if they are willing, that according to the strictest sect of our religion, I lived as a Pharisee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And now it is because of my hope in what God has promised our fathers that I am on trial today.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> This is the promise our twelve tribes are hoping to see fulfilled as they earnestly serve God day and night. O King, it is because of this hope that the Jews are accusing me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Why should any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> "I too was convinced that I ought to do all that was possible to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And that is just what I did in Jerusalem. On the authority of the chief priests I put many of the saints in prison, and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Many a time I went from one synagogue to another to have them punished, and I tried to force them to blaspheme. In my obsession against them, I even went to foreign cities to persecute them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> "On one of these journeys I was going to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> About noon, O King, as I was on the road, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, blazing around me and my companions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic,`Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> "Then I asked,`Who are you, Lord?' "`I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,' the Lord replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> `Now get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen of me and what I will show you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> "So then, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the vision from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> First to those in Damascus, then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and to the Gentiles also, I preached that they should repent and turn to God and prove their repentance by their deeds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> That is why the Jews seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> But I have had God's help to this very day, and so I stand here and testify to small and great alike. I am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> that the Christ would suffer and, as the first to rise from the dead, would proclaim light to his own people and to the Gentiles."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> At this point Festus interrupted Paul's defence. "You are out of your mind, Paul!" he shouted. "Your great learning is driving you insane."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> "I am not insane, most excellent Festus," Paul replied. "What I am saying is true and reasonable.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> The king is familiar with these things, and I can speak freely to him. I am convinced that none of this has escaped his notice, because it was not done in a corner.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Then Agrippa said to Paul, "Do you think that in such a short time you can persuade me to be a Christian?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Paul replied, "Short time or long--I pray God that not only you but all who are listening to me today may become what I am, except for these chains."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> The king rose, and with him the governor and Bernice and those sitting with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> They left the room, and while talking with one another, they said, "This man is not doing anything that deserves death or imprisonment."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Agrippa said to Festus, "This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="27">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius, who belonged to the Imperial Regiment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> We boarded a ship from Adramyttium about to sail for ports along the coast of the province of Asia, and we put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> The next day we landed at Sidon; and Julius, in kindness to Paul, allowed him to go to his friends so they might provide for his needs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> From there we put out to sea again and passed to the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> When we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on board.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> We made slow headway for many days and had difficulty arriving off Cnidus. When the wind did not allow us to hold our course, we sailed to the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> We moved along the coast with difficulty and came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Much time had been lost, and sailing had already become dangerous because by now it was after the Fast. So Paul warned them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> "Men, I can see that our voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great loss to ship and cargo, and to our own lives also."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> But the centurion, instead of listening to what Paul said, followed the advice of the pilot and of the owner of the ship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Since the harbour was unsuitable to winter in, the majority decided that we should sail on, hoping to reach Phoenix and winter there. This was a harbour in Crete, facing both south-west and north-west.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> When a gentle south wind began to blow, they thought they had obtained what they wanted; so they weighed anchor and sailed along the shore of Crete.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Before very long, a wind of hurricane force, called the "north-easter", swept down from the island.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> The ship was caught by the storm and could not head into the wind; so we gave way to it and were driven along.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> As we passed to the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were hardly able to make the lifeboat secure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> When the men had hoisted it aboard, they passed ropes under the ship itself to hold it together. Fearing that they would run aground on the sand-bars of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and let the ship be driven along.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> We took such a violent battering from the storm that the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> On the third day, they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm continued raging, we finally gave up all hope of being saved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> After the men had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up before them and said: "Men, you should have taken my advice not to sail from Crete; then you would have spared yourselves this damage and loss.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> But now I urge you to keep up your courage, because not one of you will be lost; only the ship will be destroyed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Last night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood beside me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> and said,`Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand trial before Caesar; and God has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will happen just as he told me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Nevertheless, we must run aground on some island."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> On the fourteenth night we were still being driven across the Adriatic Sea, when about midnight the sailors sensed they were approaching land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> They took soundings and found that the water was one hundred and twenty feet deep. A short time later they took soundings again and found it was ninety feet deep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Fearing that we would be dashed against the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> In an attempt to escape from the ship, the sailors let the lifeboat down into the sea, pretending they were going to lower some anchors from the bow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Then Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, "Unless these men stay with the ship, you cannot be saved."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> So the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it fall away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> Just before dawn Paul urged them all to eat. "For the last fourteen days," he said, "you have been in constant suspense and have gone without food--you haven't eaten anything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Now I urge you to take some food. You need it to survive. Not one of you will lose a single hair from his head."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> After he said this, he took some bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it and began to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> They were all encouraged and ate some food themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Altogether there were 276 of us on board.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> When they had eaten as much as they wanted, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> When daylight came, they did not recognise the land, but they saw a bay with a sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> Cutting loose the anchors, they left them in the sea and at the same time untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> But the ship struck a sand-bar and ran aground. The bow stuck fast and would not move, and the stern was broken to pieces by the pounding of the surf.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any of them from swimming away and escaping.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> But the centurion wanted to spare Paul's life and kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> The rest were to get there on planks or on pieces of the ship. In this way everyone reached land in safety.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="28">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Once safely on shore, we found out that the island was called Malta.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> The islanders showed us unusual kindness. They built a fire and welcomed us all because it was raining and cold.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Paul gathered a pile of brushwood and, as he put it on the fire, a viper, driven out by the heat, fastened itself on his hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> When the islanders saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to each other, "This man must be a murderer; for though he escaped from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> But Paul shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no ill effects.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> The people expected him to swell up or suddenly fall dead, but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> There was an estate near by that belonged to Publius, the chief official of the island. He welcomed us to his home and for three days entertained us hospitably.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> His father was sick in bed, suffering from fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him and, after prayer, placed his hands on him and healed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> When this had happened, the rest of the sick on the island came and were cured.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> They honoured us in many ways and when we were ready to sail, they furnished us with the supplies we needed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> After three months we put out to sea in a ship that had wintered in the island. It was an Alexandrian ship with the figurehead of the twin gods Castor and Pollux.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> From there we set sail and arrived at Rhegium. The next day the south wind came up, and on the following day we reached Puteoli.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> There we found some brothers who invited us to spend a week with them. And so we came to Rome.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> The brothers there had heard that we were coming, and they travelled as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. At the sight of these men Paul thanked God and was encouraged.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> When we got to Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, with a soldier to guard him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Three days later he called together the leaders of the Jews. When they had assembled, Paul said to them: "My brothers, although I have done nothing against our people or against the customs of our ancestors, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> They examined me and wanted to release me, because I was not guilty of any crime deserving death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar--not that I had any charge to bring against my own people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> For this reason I have asked to see you and talk with you. It is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> They replied, "We have not received any letters from Judea concerning you, and none of the brothers who have come from there has reported or said anything bad about you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> But we want to hear what your views are, for we know that people everywhere are talking against this sect."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> They arranged to meet Paul on a certain day, and came in even larger numbers to the place where he was staying. From morning till evening he explained and declared to them the kingdom of God and tried to convince them about Jesus from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Some were convinced by what he said, but others would not believe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> They disagreed among themselves and began to leave after Paul had made this final statement: "The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your forefathers when he said through Isaiah the prophet:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> "`Go to this people and say, "You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> For this people's heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them.' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> "Therefore I want you to know that God's salvation has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> For two whole years Paul stayed there in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to see him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Boldly and without hindrance he preached the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>

	<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="45" bname="Romans">
		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> regarding his Son, who as to his human nature was a descendant of David,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> and who through the Spirit of holiness was declared with power to be the Son of God, by his resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Through him and for his name's sake, we received grace and apostleship to call people from among all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And you also are among those who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being reported all over the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> God, whom I serve with my whole heart in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> in my prayers at all times; and I pray that now at last by God's will the way may be opened for me to come to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I planned many times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> I am bound both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are at Rome.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: "The righteous will live by faith."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshipped and served created things rather than the Creator--who is for ever praised. Amen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Furthermore, since they did not think it worth while to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practise them.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge the other, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Now we know that God's judgment against those who do such things is based on truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> So when you, a mere man, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God's judgment?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, tolerance and patience, not realising that God's kindness leads you towards repentance?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God's wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> God "will give to each person according to what he has done". </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honour and immortality, he will give eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> but glory, honour and peace for everyone who does good: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> For God does not show favouritism.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God's sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> (Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> since they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> This will take place on the day when God will judge men's secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if you rely on the law and brag about your relationship to God;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> if you know his will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those who are in the dark,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> You who say that people should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> You who brag about the law, do you dishonour God by breaking the law?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> As it is written: "God's name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, you have become as though you had not been circumcised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> If those who are not circumcised keep the law's requirements, will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a law-breaker.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> A man is not a Jew if he is only one outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> No, a man is a Jew if he is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a man's praise is not from men, but from God.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> What advantage, then, is there in being a Jew, or what value is there in circumcision?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Much in every way! First of all, they have been entrusted with the very words of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> What if some did not have faith? Will their lack of faith nullify God's faithfulness?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Not at all! Let God be true, and every man a liar. As it is written: "So that you may be proved right when you speak and prevail when you judge." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> But if our unrighteousness brings out God's righteousness more clearly, what shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a human argument.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Certainly not! If that were so, how could God judge the world?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Someone might argue, "If my falsehood enhances God's truthfulness and so increases his glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Why not say--as we are being slanderously reported as saying and as some claim that we say--"Let us do evil that good may result"? Their condemnation is deserved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> What shall we conclude then? Are we any better? Not at all! We have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> As it is written: "There is no-one righteous, not even one;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> there is no-one who understands, no-one who seeks God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no-one who does good, not even one." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> "Their throats are open graves; their tongues practise deceit." "The poison of vipers is on their lips."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> "Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> "Their feet are swift to shed blood;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> ruin and misery mark their ways,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> and the way of peace they do not know." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> "There is no fear of God before their eyes." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Therefore no-one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> But now a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood. He did this to demonstrate his justice, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> he did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. On what principle? On that of observing the law? No, but on that of faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from observing the law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, discovered in this matter?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about--but not before God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> What does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Now when a man works, his wages are not credited to him as a gift, but as an obligation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> However, to the man who does not work but trusts God who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as righteousness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> "Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will never count against him." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Is this blessedness only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham's faith was credited to him as righteousness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Under what circumstances was it credited? Was it after he was circumcised, or before? It was not after, but before!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be credited to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And he is also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> It was not through law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes by faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> For if those who live by law are heirs, faith has no value and the promise is worthless,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> because law brings wrath. And where there is no law there is no transgression.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham's offspring--not only to those who are of the law but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> As it is written: "I have made you a father of many nations." He is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed--the God who gives life to the dead and calls things that are not as though they were.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, "So shall your offspring be." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead--since he was about a hundred years old--and that Sarah's womb was also dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> This is why "it was credited to him as righteousness."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> The words "it was credited to him" were written not for him alone,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness-- for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> perseverance, character; and character, hope.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> For if, when we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Not only is this so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> for before the law was given, sin was in the world. But sin is not taken into account when there is no law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who was a pattern of the one to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Again, the gift of God is not like the result of the one man's sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Consequently, just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men, so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> The law was added so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning, so that grace may increase?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> By no means! We died to sin; how can we live in it any longer?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Or don't you know that all of us who were baptised into Christ Jesus were baptised into his death?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> If we have been united with him like this in his death, we will certainly also be united with him in his resurrection.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> because anyone who has died has been freed from sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Do not offer the parts of your body to sin, as instruments of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God, as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer the parts of your body to him as instruments of righteousness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under law, but under grace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone to obey him as slaves, you are slaves to the one whom you obey-- whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you wholeheartedly obeyed the form of teaching to which you were entrusted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> I put this in human terms because you are weak in your natural selves. Just as you used to offer the parts of your body in slavery to impurity and to ever-increasing wickedness, so now offer them in slavery to righteousness leading to holiness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Do you not know, brothers--for I am speaking to men who know the law--that the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> So, my brothers, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> For when we were controlled by the sinful nature, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies, so that we bore fruit for death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed I would not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, "Do not covet." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetous desire. For apart from law, sin is dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Once I was alive apart from law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! But in order that sin might be recognised as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do--this I keep on doing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> So I find this law at work: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> For in my inner being I delight in God's law;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> but I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Thanks be to God--through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God's law, but in the sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the sinful nature, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in sinful man,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the sinful nature but according to the Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> The mind of sinful man is death, but the mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> the sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Those controlled by the sinful nature cannot please God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit, who lives in you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Therefore, brothers, we have an obligation--but it is not to the sinful nature, to live according to it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> For if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship. And by him we cry, "Abba, Father."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Now if we are children, then we are heirs--heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he already has?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God's will.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all--how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Who is he that condemns? Christ Jesus, who died--more than that, who was raised to life--is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> As it is written: "For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> I speak the truth in Christ--I am not lying, my conscience confirms it in the Holy Spirit--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, those of my own race,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption as sons; theirs the divine glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship and the promises.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry of Christ, who is God over all, for ever praised! Amen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> It is not as though God's word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham's children. On the contrary, "It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> In other words, it is not the natural children who are God's children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham's offspring.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> For this was how the promise was stated: "At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Not only that, but Rebekah's children had one and the same father, our father Isaac.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad--in order that God's purpose in election might stand:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> not by works but by him who calls--she was told, "The older will serve the younger." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Just as it is written: "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> For he says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> It does not, therefore, depend on man's desire or effort, but on God's mercy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: "I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> One of you will say to me: "Then why does God still blame us? For who resists his will?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> But who are you, O man, to talk back to God? "Shall what is formed say to him who formed it,`Why did you make me like this?'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for noble purposes and some for common use?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> What if God, choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath-- prepared for destruction?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> As he says in Hosea: "I will call them`my people' who are not my people; and I will call her`my loved one' who is not my loved one,"</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="28"> For the Lord will carry out his sentence on earth with speed and finality." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> It is just as Isaiah said previously: "Unless the Lord Almighty had left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> but Israel, who pursued a law of righteousness, has not attained it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the "stumbling-stone".</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="4"> Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Moses describes in this way the righteousness that is by the law: "The man who does these things will live by them." </VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="10"> For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> As the Scripture says, "Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile--the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="14"> How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!" </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> But not all the Israelites accepted the good news. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our message?" </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course they did: "Their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Again I ask: Did Israel not understand? First, Moses says, "I will make you envious by those who are not a nation; I will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And Isaiah boldly says, "I was found by those who did not seek me; I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> But concerning Israel he says, "All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people." </VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> I ask then: Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don't you know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah--how he appealed to God against Israel:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> "Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me"? </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And what was God's answer to him? "I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> What then? What Israel sought so earnestly it did not obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> as it is written: "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes so that they could not see and ears so that they could not hear, to this very day." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And David says: "May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling-block and a retribution for them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent for ever." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fulness bring!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I make much of my ministry</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> do not boast over those branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: "The deliverer will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies on your account; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now receive mercy as a result of God's mercy to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> For God has bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> "Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counsellor?" </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> "Who has ever given to God, that God should repay him?" </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory for ever! Amen.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God--this is your spiritual act of worship.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is--his good, pleasing and perfect will.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the measure of faith God has given you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> so in Christ we who are many form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> We have different gifts, according to the grace given us. If a man's gift is prophesying, let him use it in proportion to his faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> If it is serving, let him serve; if it is teaching, let him teach;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> if it is encouraging, let him encourage; if it is contributing to the needs of others, let him give generously; if it is leadership, let him govern diligently; if it is showing mercy, let him do it cheerfully.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Be devoted to one another in brotherly love. Honour one another above yourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervour, serving the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Share with God's people who are in need. Practise hospitality.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position. Do not be conceited.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everybody.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Do not take revenge, my friends, but leave room for God's wrath, for it is written: "It is mine to avenge; I will repay," says the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> On the contrary: "If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and he will commend you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> For he is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to governing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Give everyone what you owe him: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honour, then honour.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for he who loves his fellow-man has fulfilled the law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> The commandments, "Do not commit adultery," "Do not murder," "Do not steal," "Do not covet," and whatever other commandment there may be, are summed up in this one rule: "Love your neighbour as yourself."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Love does no harm to its neighbour. Therefore love is the fulfilment of the law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And do this, understanding the present time. The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armour of light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature. </VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Accept him whose faith is weak, without passing judgment on disputable matters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> One man's faith allows him to eat everything, but another man, whose faith is weak, eats only vegetables.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> The man who eats everything must not look down on him who does not, and the man who does not eat everything must not condemn the man who does, for God has accepted him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Who are you to judge someone else's servant? To his own master he stands or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> One man considers one day more sacred than another; another man considers every day alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> He who regards one day as special, does so to the Lord. He who eats meat, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who abstains, does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> For none of us lives to himself alone and none of us dies to himself alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> If we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> For this very reason, Christ died and returned to life so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> You, then, why do you judge your brother? Or why do you look down on your brother? For we will all stand before God's judgment seat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> It is written: "`As surely as I live,' says the Lord,`Every knee will bow before me; every tongue will confess to God.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling-block or obstacle in your brother's way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> As one who is in the Lord Jesus, I am fully convinced that no food is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for him it is unclean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> If your brother is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy your brother for whom Christ died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Do not allow what you consider good to be spoken of as evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother to fall.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the man who does not condemn himself by what he approves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> But the man who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Each of us should please his neighbour for his good, to build him up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> For even Christ did not please himself but, as it is written: "The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you a spirit of unity among yourselves as you follow Christ Jesus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> so that with one heart and mouth you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring praise to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the Jews on behalf of God's truth, to confirm the promises made to the patriarchs</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> so that the Gentiles may glorify God for his mercy, as it is written: "Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles; I will sing hymns to your name."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Again, it says, "Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And again, "Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and sing praises to him, all you peoples." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And again, Isaiah says, "The Root of Jesse will spring up, one who will arise to rule over the nations; the Gentiles will hope in him." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> I myself am convinced, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, complete in knowledge and competent to instruct one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> I have written to you quite boldly on some points, as if to remind you of them again, because of the grace God gave me</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles with the priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Therefore I glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> by the power of signs and miracles, through the power of the Spirit. So from Jerusalem all the way round to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> It has always been my ambition to preach the gospel where Christ was not known, so that I would not be building on someone else's foundation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Rather, as it is written: "Those who were not told about him will see, and those who have not heard will understand." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> This is why I have often been hindered from coming to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> But now that there is no more place for me to work in these regions, and since I have been longing for many years to see you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> I plan to do so when I go to Spain. I hope to visit you while passing through and to have you assist me on my journey there, after I have enjoyed your company for a while.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem in the service of the saints there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in the Jews' spiritual blessings, they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material blessings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> So after I have completed this task and have made sure that they have received this fruit, I will go to Spain and visit you on the way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> I know that when I come to you, I will come in the full measure of the blessing of Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> I urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Pray that I may be rescued from the unbelievers in Judea and that my service in Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints there,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> so that by God's will I may come to you with joy and together with you be refreshed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> The God of peace be with you all. Amen.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a servant of the church in Cenchrea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> I ask you to receive her in the Lord in a way worthy of the saints and to give her any help she may need from you, for she has been a great help to many people, including me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow-workers in Christ Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> They risked their lives for me. Not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Greet also the church that meets at their house. Greet my dear friend Epenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in the province of Asia.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Greet Mary, who worked very hard for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Greet Andronicus and Junias, my relatives who have been in prison with me. They are outstanding among the apostles, and they were in Christ before I was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Greet Ampliatus, whom I love in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Greet Urbanus, our fellow-worker in Christ, and my dear friend Stachys.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Greet Apelles, tested and approved in Christ. Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Greet Herodion, my relative. Greet those in the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, those women who work hard in the Lord. Greet my dear friend Persis, another woman who has worked very hard in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother, who has been a mother to me, too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas and the brothers with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Greet Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas and all the saints with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send greetings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> I urge you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Everyone has heard about your obedience, so I am full of joy over you; but I want you to be wise about what is good, and innocent about what is evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Timothy, my fellow-worker, sends his greetings to you, as do Lucius, Jason and Sosipater, my relatives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> I, Tertius, who wrote down this letter, greet you in the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Gaius, whose hospitality I and the whole church here enjoy, sends you his greetings. Erastus, who is the city's director of public works, and our brother Quartus send you their greetings.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> [“May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. Amen”]</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Now to him who is able to establish you by my gospel and the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages past,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal God, so that all nations might believe and obey him--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> to the only wise God be glory for ever through Jesus Christ! Amen.</VERS>
