		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> A record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ the son of David, the son of Abraham:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Judah the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar, Perez the father of Hezron, Hezron the father of Ram,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Ram the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Salmon the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth, Obed the father of Jesse,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> and Jesse the father of King David. David was the father of Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah's wife,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Jehoram, Jehoram the father of Uzziah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, Amon the father of Josiah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> After the exile to Babylon: Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azor,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Akim, Akim the father of Eliud,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Christ. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> All this took place to fulfil what the Lord had said through the prophet:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> "The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel"-- which means, "God with us."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> and asked, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> When King Herod heard this he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> When he had called together all the people's chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Christ was to be born.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> "In Bethlehem in Judea," they replied, "for this is what the prophet has written:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> "`But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people Israel.'" </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> He sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and make a careful search for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> When they saw the star, they were overjoyed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshipped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and of incense and of myrrh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. "Get up," he said, "take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: "Out of Egypt I called my son." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> When Herod realised that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> "A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child's life are dead."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets: "He will be called a Nazarene."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the Desert of Judea</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> and saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah: "A voice of one calling in the desert,`Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> John's clothes were made of camel's hair, and he had a leather belt round his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the Jordan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Confessing their sins, they were baptised by him in the Jordan River.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptising, he said to them: "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And do not think you can say to yourselves,`We have Abraham as our father.' I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> The axe is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> "I baptise you with water for repentance. But after me will come one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not fit to carry. He will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing-floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptised by John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> But John tried to deter him, saying, "I need to be baptised by you, and do you come to me?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Jesus replied, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfil all righteousness." Then John consented.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> As soon as Jesus was baptised, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> After fasting for forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Jesus answered, "It is written:`Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> "If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down. For it is written: "`He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'" </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Jesus answered him, "It is also written:`Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendour.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> "All this I will give you," he said, "if you will bow down and worship me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Jesus said to him, "Away from me, Satan! For it is written:`Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he returned to Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> to fulfil what was said through the prophet Isaiah:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> "Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the way to the sea, along the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> From that time on Jesus began to preach, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> "Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> At once they left their nets and followed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> News about him spread all over Syria, and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralysed, and he healed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Large crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and the region across the Jordan followed him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now when he saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> and he began to teach them, saying:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> "Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> "You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> "You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfil them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practises and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> "You have heard that it was said to the people long ago,`Do not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother,`Raca,' is answerable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says,`You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> "Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> "Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still with him on the way, or he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> I tell you the truth, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> "You have heard that it was said,`Do not commit adultery.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> "It has been said,`Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> "Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago,`Do not break your oath, but keep the oaths you have made to the Lord.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> But I tell you, Do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is God's throne;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Simply let your`Yes' be`Yes', and your`No',`No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> "You have heard that it was said,`Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> "You have heard that it was said,`Love your neighbour and hate your enemy.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> "Be careful not to do your`acts of righteousness' before men, to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> "So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honoured by men. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> "And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> "This, then, is how you should pray: "`Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Give us today our daily bread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> "When you fast, do not look sombre as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> so that it will not be obvious to men that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> "The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> But if your eyes are bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> "No-one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> "And why do you worry about clothes? See how the lilies of the field grow. They do not labour or spin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendour was dressed like one of these.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> So do not worry, saying,`What shall we eat?' or`What shall we drink?' or`What shall we wear?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="15"> "Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> By their fruit you will recognise them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Likewise every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="21"> "Not everyone who says to me,`Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Many will say to me on that day,`Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Then I will tell them plainly,`I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> "Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="27"> The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> When he came down from the mountainside, large crowds followed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> A man with leprosy came and knelt before him and said, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" Immediately he was cured of his leprosy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Then Jesus said to him, "See that you don't tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> "Lord," he said, "my servant lies at home paralysed and in terrible suffering."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Jesus said to him, "I will go and heal him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> The centurion replied, "Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one,`Go,' and he goes; and that one,`Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant,`Do this,' and he does it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> When Jesus heard this, he was astonished and said to those following him, "I tell you the truth, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go! It will be done just as you believed it would." And his servant was healed at that very hour.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> This was to fulfil what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: "He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Jesus replied, "Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Another disciple said to him, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> But Jesus told him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Without warning, a furious storm came up on the lake, so that the waves swept over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> The disciples went and woke him, saying, "Lord, save us! We're going to drown!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> He replied, "You of little faith, why are you so afraid?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> The men were amazed and asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> When he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were so violent that no-one could pass that way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> "What do you want with us, Son of God?" they shouted. "Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> He said to them, "Go!" So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> Those tending the pigs ran off, went into the town and reported all this, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their region.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Jesus stepped into a boat, crossed over and came to his own town.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Some men brought to him a paralytic, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> At this, some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, "This fellow is blaspheming!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Which is easier: to say,`Your sins are forgiven,' or to say,`Get up and walk'?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...." Then he said to the paralytic, "Get up, take your mat and go home."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And the man got up and went home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe; and they praised God, who had given such authority to men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house, many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with him and his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and`sinners'?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> On hearing this, Jesus said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> But go and learn what this means:`I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Then John's disciples came and asked him, "How is it that we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> "No-one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Neither do men pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> While he was saying this, a ruler came and knelt before him and said, "My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Jesus got up and went with him, and so did his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> She said to herself, "If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Jesus turned and saw her. "Take heart, daughter," he said, "your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed from that moment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> When Jesus entered the ruler's house and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> he said, "Go away. The girl is not dead but asleep." But they laughed at him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> After the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> News of this spread through all that region.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> When he had gone indoors, the blind men came to him, and he asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" "Yes, Lord," they replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Then he touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith will it be done to you";</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> and their sight was restored. Jesus warned them sternly, "See that no-one knows about this."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> While they were going out, a man who was demon-possessed and could not talk was brought to Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> And when the demon was driven out, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowd was amazed and said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> But the Pharisees said, "It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> He called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> After Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> When John heard in prison what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> to ask him, "Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Jesus replied, "Go back and report to John what you hear and see:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: "What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear fine clothes are in kings' palaces.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> This is the one about whom it is written: "`I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> I tell you the truth: Among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful men lay hold of it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> He who has ears, let him hear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> "To what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the market-places and calling out to others:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> "`We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say,`He has a demon.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say,`Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and "sinners".' But wisdom is proved right by her actions."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of his miracles had been performed, because they did not repent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> "Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the skies? No, you will go down to the depths. If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure.</VERS>

		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> At that time Jesus went through the cornfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick some ears of corn and eat them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> He answered, "Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread--which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Or haven't you read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple desecrate the day and yet are innocent?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> I tell you that one greater than the temple is here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> If you had known what these words mean,`I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the innocent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Going on from that place, he went into their synagogue,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> and a man with a shrivelled hand was there. Looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, they asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> He said to them, "If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> warning them not to tell who he was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> This was to fulfil what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> "Here is my servant whom I have chosen, the one I love, in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> He will not quarrel or cry out; no-one will hear his voice in the streets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> A bruised reed he will not break, and a smouldering wick he will not snuff out, till he leads justice to victory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> In his name the nations will put their hope." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> All the people were astonished and said, "Could this be the Son of David?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, "It is only by Beelzebub, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And if I drive out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> "Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can rob his house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> "He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> And so I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> "Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is recognised by its fruit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good? For out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> But I tell you that men will have to give account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> He answered, "A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a miraculous sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and now one greater than Solomon is here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> "When an evil spirit comes out of a man, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> Then it says,`I will return to the house I left.' When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied, swept clean and put in order.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that man is worse than the first. That is how it will be with this wicked generation."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> He replied to him, "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> Pointing to his disciples, he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Such large crowds gathered round him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Then he told them many things in parables, saying: "A farmer went out to sow his seed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop--a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> He who has ears, let him hear."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> The disciples came to him and asked, "Why do you speak to the people in parables?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> He replied, "The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> This is why I speak to them in parables: "Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: "`You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> For this people's heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them.' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> For I tell you the truth, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> "Listen then to what the parable of the sower means:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> The one who received the seed that fell on rocky places is the man who hears the word and at once receives it with joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> But since he has no root, he lasts only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it, making it unfruitful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> But the one who received the seed that fell on good soil is the man who hears the word and understands it. He produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> When the wheat sprouted and formed ears, then the weeds also appeared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> "The owner's servants came to him and said,`Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> "`An enemy did this,' he replied. "The servants asked him,`Do you want us to go and pull them up?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> "`No,' he answered,`because while you are pulling the weeds, you may root up the wheat with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> He told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Though it is the smallest of all your seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and perch in its branches."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> He told them still another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it worked all through the dough."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> He answered, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> "As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> They will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> "The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> "Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> "Have you understood all these things?" Jesus asked. "Yes," they replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> He said to them, "Therefore every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> Coming to his home town, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?" they asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55"> "Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary, and aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56"> Aren't all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57"> And they took offence at him. But Jesus said to them, "Only in his home town and in his own house is a prophet without honour."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58"> And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> and he said to his attendants, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> for John had been saying to him: "It is not lawful for you to have her."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the people, because they considered him a prophet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> On Herod's birthday the daughter of Herodias danced for them and pleased Herod so much</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Prompted by her mother, she said, "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> The king was distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he ordered that her request be granted</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> and had John beheaded in the prison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> His head was brought in on a platter and given to the girl, who carried it to her mother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> When Jesus heard what had happened, he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place. Hearing of this, the crowds followed him on foot from the towns.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them and healed their sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away, so that they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Jesus replied, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> "We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish," they answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> "Bring them here to me," he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And he directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> The number of those who ate was about five thousand men, besides women and children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> but the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> During the fourth watch of the night Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. "It's a ghost," they said, and cried out in fear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> But Jesus immediately said to them: "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> "Lord, if it's you," Peter replied, "tell me to come to you on the water."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> "Come," he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came towards Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, "Lord, save me!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> Then those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> And when the men of that place recognised Jesus, they sent word to all the surrounding country. People brought all their sick to him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> and begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched him were healed.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> "Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don't wash their hands before they eat!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Jesus replied, "And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> For God said,`Honour your father and mother' and`Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> But you say that if a man says to his father or mother,`Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is a gift devoted to God,'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> he is not to`honour his father' with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> "`These people honour me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.'" </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> What goes into a man's mouth does not make him`unclean', but what comes out of his mouth, that is what makes him`unclean'."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Then the disciples came to him and asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> He replied, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Leave them; they are blind guides. If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Peter said, "Explain the parable to us."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> "Are you still so dull?" Jesus asked them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> "Don't you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these make a man`unclean'.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> These are what make a man`unclean'; but eating with unwashed hands does not make him`unclean'."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is suffering terribly from demon-possession."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, "Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> He answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> The woman came and knelt before him. "Lord, help me!" she said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> He replied, "It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> "Yes, Lord," she said, "but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Then Jesus answered, "Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted." And her daughter was healed from that very hour.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Great crowds came to him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute and many others, and laid them at his feet; and he healed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> His disciples answered, "Where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> "How many loaves do you have?" Jesus asked. "Seven," they replied, "and a few small fish."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> He told the crowd to sit down on the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and when he had given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they in turn to the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> They all ate and were satisfied. Afterwards the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> The number of those who ate was four thousand, besides women and children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and went to the vicinity of Magadan.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> He replied, "When evening comes, you say,`It will be fair weather, for the sky is red,'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> and in the morning,`Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah." Jesus then left them and went away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> When they went across the lake, the disciples forgot to take bread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> "Be careful," Jesus said to them. "Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> They discussed this among themselves and said, "It is because we didn't bring any bread."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked, "You of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Do you still not understand? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> How is it you don't understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> "But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Jesus replied, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by man, but by my Father in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Then he warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. "Never, Lord!" he said. "This shall never happen to you!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling-block to me; you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what he has done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters--one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> When the disciples heard this, they fell face down to the ground, terrified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> But Jesus came and touched them. "Get up," he said. "Don't be afraid."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> When they looked up, they saw no-one except Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them, "Don't tell anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> The disciples asked him, "Why then do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Jesus replied, "To be sure, Elijah comes and will restore all things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognise him, but have done to him everything they wished. In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> When they came to the crowd, a man approached Jesus and knelt before him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> "Lord, have mercy on my son," he said. "He has seizures and is suffering greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> "O unbelieving and perverse generation," Jesus replied, "how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and he was healed from that moment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> He replied, "Because you have so little faith. I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain,`Move from here to there' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> When they came together in Galilee, he said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> They will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised to life." And the disciples were filled with grief.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> After Jesus and his disciples arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma tax came to Peter and asked, "Doesn't your teacher pay the temple tax?" </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> "Yes, he does," he replied. When Peter came into the house, Jesus was the first to speak. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "From whom do the kings of the earth collect duty and taxes--from their own sons or from others?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> "From others," Peter answered. "Then the sons are exempt," Jesus said to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> "But so that we may not offend them, go to the lake and throw out your line. Take the first fish you catch; open its mouth and you will find a four-drachma coin. Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> He called a little child and had him stand among them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And he said: "I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> "And whoever welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> "Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to sin! Such things must come, but woe to the man through whom they come!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> "See that you do not look down on one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> "What do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And if he finds it, I tell you the truth, he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should be lost.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> "If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that`every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> "I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> "Again, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> "Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> "The servant fell on his knees before him.`Be patient with me,' he begged,`and I will pay back everything.'</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="30"> "But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> When the other servants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed and went and told their master everything that had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> "Then the master called the servant in.`You wicked servant,' he said,`I cancelled all that debt of yours because you begged me to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow-servant just as I had on you?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> In anger his master turned him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea to the other side of the Jordan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> "Haven't you read," he replied, "that at the beginning the Creator`made them male and female',</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> and said,`For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh'?</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="7"> "Why then," they asked, "did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Jesus replied, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, and marries another woman commits adultery."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> The disciples said to him, "If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Jesus replied, "Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> For some are eunuchs because they were born that way; others were made that way by men; and others have renounced marriage because of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Then little children were brought to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked those who brought them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> When he had placed his hands on them, he went on from there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Now a man came up to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> "Why do you ask me about what is good?" Jesus replied. "There is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, obey the commandments."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> "Which ones?" the man enquired. Jesus replied, "`Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> honour your father and mother,' and`love your neighbour as yourself.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> "All these I have kept," the young man said. "What do I still lack?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Then Jesus said to his disciples, "I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, "Who then can be saved?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Peter answered him, "We have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> "For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire men to work in his vineyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> "About the third hour he went out and saw others standing in the market-place doing nothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> He told them,`You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> So they went. "He went out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did the same thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> About the eleventh hour he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them,`Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> "`Because no-one has hired us,' they answered. "He said to them,`You also go and work in my vineyard.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> "When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman,`Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> "The workers who were hired about the eleventh hour came and each received a denarius.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> `These men who were hired last worked only one hour,' they said,`and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> "But he answered one of them,`Friend, I am not being unfair to you. Didn't you agree to work for a denarius?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Take your pay and go. I want to give the man who was hired last the same as I gave you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> "So the last will be first, and the first will be last."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Now as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> "We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> and will turn him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified. On the third day he will be raised to life!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Jesus with her sons and, kneeling down, asked a favour of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> "What is it you want?" he asked. She said, "Grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> "You don't know what you are asking," Jesus said to them. "Can you drink the cup I am going to drink?" "We can," they answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> When the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> and whoever wants to be first must be your slave--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was going by, they shouted, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet, but they shouted all the louder, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Jesus stopped and called them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> "Lord," they answered, "we want our sight."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and followed him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> saying to them, "Go to the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> If anyone says anything to you, tell him that the Lord needs them, and he will send them right away."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> This took place to fulfil what was spoken through the prophet:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> "Say to the Daughter of Zion,`See, your king comes to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> They brought the donkey and the colt, placed their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" "Hosanna in the highest!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, "Who is this?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> The crowds answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money-changers and the benches of those selling doves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> "It is written," he said to them, "`My house will be called a house of prayer,' but you are making it a`den of robbers'."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> The blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple area, "Hosanna to the Son of David," they were indignant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> "Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," replied Jesus, "have you never read, "`From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise'?" </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Early in the morning, as he was on his way back to the city, he was hungry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Seeing a fig-tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" Immediately the tree withered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. "How did the fig-tree wither so quickly?" they asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig-tree, but also you can say to this mountain,`Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Jesus entered the temple courts, and, while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. "By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you this authority?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Jesus replied, "I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> John's baptism--where did it come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?" They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say,`From heaven', he will ask,`Then why didn't you believe him?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> But if we say,`From men'--we are afraid of the people, for they all hold that John was a prophet."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." Then he said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> "What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said,`Son, go and work today in the vineyard.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> "`I will not,' he answered, but later he changed his mind and went.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> "Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered,`I will, sir,' but he did not go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> "Which of the two did what his father wanted?" "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> "Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> When the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> "The tenants seized his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Then he sent other servants to them, more than the first time, and the tenants treated them in the same way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Last of all, he sent his son to them.`They will respect my son,' he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> "But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other,`This is the heir. Come, let's kill him and take his inheritance.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> "Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> "He will bring those wretches to a wretched end," they replied, "and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: "`The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvellous in our eyes'?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> "Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables, they knew he was talking about them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> They looked for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="22">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> "The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> "Then he sent some more servants and said,`Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> "But they paid no attention and went off--one to his field, another to his business.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> The rest seized his servants, ill-treated them and killed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> "Then he said to his servants,`The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> "But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> `Friend,' he asked,`how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' The man was speechless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> "Then the king told the attendants,`Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> "For many are invited, but few are chosen."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. "Teacher," they said, "we know you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, "You hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Show me the coin used for paying the tax." They brought him a denarius,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> and he asked them, "Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> "Caesar's," they replied. Then he said to them, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> "Teacher," they said, "Moses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and have children for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> The same thing happened to the second and third brother, right on down to the seventh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Finally, the woman died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Jesus replied, "You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> But about the resurrection of the dead--have you not read what God said to you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> `I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not the God of the dead but of the living."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Jesus replied: "`Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> This is the first and greatest commandment.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> And the second is like it:`Love your neighbour as yourself.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> "What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?" "The son of David," they replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> He said to them, "How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him`Lord'? For he says,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> "`The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet."' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> If then David calls him`Lord', how can he be his son?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> No-one could say a word in reply, and from that day on no-one dared to ask him any more questions.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> So you must obey them and do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practise what they preach.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> They tie up heavy loads and put them on men's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> "Everything they do is done for men to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> they love the place of honour at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> they love to be greeted in the market-places and to have men call them`Rabbi'.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="26">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> "As you know, the Passover is two days away--and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> and they plotted to arrest Jesus in some sly way and kill him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> "But not during the Feast," they said, "or there may be a riot among the people."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. "Why this waste?" they asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> "This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Aware of this, Jesus said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> When she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> I tell you the truth, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Then one of the Twelve--the one called Judas Iscariot--went to the chief priests</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> and asked, "What are you willing to give me if I hand him over to you?" So they counted out for him thirty silver coins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> From then on Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> He replied, "Go into the city to a certain man and tell him,`The Teacher says: My appointed time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> And while they were eating, he said, "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other, "Surely not I, Lord?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Jesus replied, "The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, "Surely not I, Rabbi?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father's kingdom."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Then Jesus told them, "This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: "`I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> Peter replied, "Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "this very night, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> But Peter declared, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you." And all the other disciples said the same.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Then he said to them, "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Could you men not keep watch with me for one hour?" he asked Peter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> "Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> He went away a second time and prayed, "My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> Rise, let us go! Here comes my betrayer!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> Jesus replied, "Friend, do what you came for." Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus and arrested him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> With that, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> "Put your sword back in its place," Jesus said to him, "for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55"> At that time Jesus said to the crowd, "Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56"> But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57"> Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58"> But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59"> The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60"> But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally two came forward</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61"> and declared, "This fellow said,`I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62"> Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63"> But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64"> "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied. "But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65"> Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66"> What do you think?" "He is worthy of death," they answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67"> Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="68"> and said, "Prophesy to us, Christ. Who hit you?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="69"> Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. "You also were with Jesus of Galilee," she said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="70"> But he denied it before them all. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="71"> Then he went out to the gateway, where another girl saw him and said to the people there, "This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="72"> He denied it again, with an oath: "I don't know the man!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="73"> After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, "Surely you are one of them, for your accent gives you away."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="74"> Then he began to call down curses on himself and he swore to them, "I don't know the man!" Immediately a cock crowed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="75"> Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: "Before the cock crows, you will disown me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="27">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people came to the decision to put Jesus to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> They bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> "I have sinned," he said, "for I have betrayed innocent blood." "What is that to us?" they replied. "That's your responsibility."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> The chief priests picked up the coins and said, "It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> So they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: "They took the thirty silver coins, the price set on him by the people of Israel,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> and they used them to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Then Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge--to the great amazement of the governor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Now it was the governor's custom at the Feast to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> At that time they had a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him this message: "Don't have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> "Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> "What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called Christ?" Pilate asked. They all answered, "Crucify him!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> "Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> All the people answered, "Let his blood be on us and on our children!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers round him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand and knelt in front of him and mocked him. "Hail, king of the Jews!" they said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> They spat on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> They came to a place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull).</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> And sitting down, they kept watch over him there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Above his head they placed the written charge against him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> and saying, "You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> "He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! He's the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said,`I am the Son of God.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> In the same way the robbers who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?"--which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> When some of those standing there heard this, they said, "He's calling Elijah."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> The rest said, "Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> They came out of the tombs, and after Jesus' resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, "Surely he was the Son of God!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55"> Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56"> Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57"> As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58"> Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59"> Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60"> and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61"> Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62"> The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63"> "Sir," they said, "we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said,`After three days I will rise again.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64"> So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65"> "Take a guard," Pilate answered. "Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66"> So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="28">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Then go quickly and tell his disciples:`He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings," he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshipped him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> telling them, "You are to say,`His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> When they saw him, they worshipped him; but some doubted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."</VERS>

	<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="41" bname="Mark">
		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> It is written in Isaiah the prophet: "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way"-- </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> "a voice of one calling in the desert,`Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And so John came, baptising in the desert region and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptised by him in the Jordan River.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt round his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And this was his message: "After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> I baptise you with water, but he will baptise you with the Holy Spirit."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptised by John in the Jordan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> and he was in the desert for forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> "The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> "Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> At once they left their nets and followed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> "What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> "Be quiet!" said Jesus sternly. "Come out of him!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching--and with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> The whole town gathered at the door,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Simon and his companions went to look for him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> and when they found him, they exclaimed: "Everyone is looking for you!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else--to the nearby villages--so that I can preach there also. That is why I have come."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> So he travelled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> "See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> So many gathered that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Some men came, bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging through it, lowered the mat the paralysed man was lying on.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> "Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Which is easier: to say to the paralytic,`Your sins are forgiven,' or to say,`Get up, take your mat and walk'?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...." He said to the paralytic,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> "I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> While Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house, many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the "sinners" and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: "Why does he eat with tax collectors and`sinners'?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> On hearing this, Jesus said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, "How is it that John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> "No-one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And no-one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, he pours new wine into new wineskins."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> One Sabbath Jesus was going through the cornfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some ears of corn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> The Pharisees said to him, "Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> He answered, "Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Then he said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Another time he went into the synagogue, and a man with a shrivelled hand was there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Jesus said to the man with the shrivelled hand, "Stand up in front of everyone."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Then Jesus asked them, "Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?" But they remained silent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> He looked round at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee followed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> When they heard all he was doing, many people came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, to keep the people from crowding him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> For he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Whenever the evil spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> But he gave them strict orders not to tell who he was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> He appointed twelve--designating them apostles-- that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> and to have authority to drive out demons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> These are the twelve he appointed: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter);</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to them he gave the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder);</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, "He is out of his mind."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Beelzebub! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> So Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables: "How can Satan drive out Satan?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> In fact, no-one can enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can rob his house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> I tell you the truth, all the sins and blasphemies of men will be forgiven them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of an eternal sin."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> He said this because they were saying, "He has an evil spirit."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Then Jesus' mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, "Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> "Who are my mother and my brothers?" he asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, "Here are my mother and my brothers!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Whoever does God's will is my brother and sister and mother."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Again Jesus began to teach by the lake. The crowd that gathered round him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake, while all the people were along the shore at the water's edge.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> He taught them many things by parables, and in his teaching said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> "Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, multiplying thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Then Jesus said, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> He told them, "The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> so that, "`they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!'" </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Then Jesus said to them, "Don't you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> The farmer sows the word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop--thirty, sixty or even a hundred times what was sown."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> He said to them, "Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed? Instead, don't you put it on its stand?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> "Consider carefully what you hear," he continued. "With the measure you use, it will be measured to you--and even more.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> He also said, "This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> All by itself the soil produces corn--first the stalk, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Again he said, "What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest seed you plant in the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds of the air can perch in its shade."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, "Let us go over to the other side."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, "Teacher, don't you care if we drown?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, "Quiet! Be still!" Then the wind died down and it was completely calm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> He said to his disciples, "Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> They were terrified and asked each other, "Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!"</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an evil spirit came from the tombs to meet him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> This man lived in the tombs, and no-one could bind him any more, not even with a chain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No-one was strong enough to subdue him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> He shouted at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Swear to God that you won't torture me!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> For Jesus had said to him, "Come out of this man, you evil spirit!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Then Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" "My name is Legion," he replied, "for we are many."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> The demons begged Jesus, "Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> He gave them permission, and the evil spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man--and told about the pigs as well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Jesus did not let him, but said, "Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered round him while he was by the lake.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came there. Seeing Jesus, he fell at his feet</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> and pleaded earnestly with him, "My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> So Jesus went with him. A large crowd followed and pressed around him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> because she thought, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> At once Jesus realised that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> "You see the people crowding against you," his disciples answered, "and yet you can ask,`Who touched me?'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> While Jesus was still speaking, some men came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. "Your daughter is dead," they said. "Why bother the teacher any more?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Ignoring what they said, Jesus told the synagogue ruler, "Don't be afraid; just believe."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> When they came to the home of the synagogue ruler, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> He went in and said to them, "Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> But they laughed at him. After he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> He took her by the hand and said to her, "Talitha koum!" (which means, "Little girl, I say to you, get up!").</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> Immediately the girl stood up and walked around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Jesus left there and went to his home town, accompanied by his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed. "Where did this man get these things?" they asked. "What's this wisdom that has been given him, that he even does miracles!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Isn't this the carpenter? Isn't this Mary's son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?" And they took offence at him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Jesus said to them, "Only in his home town, among his relatives and in his own house is a prophet without honour."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And he was amazed at their lack of faith. Then Jesus went round teaching from village to village.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Calling the Twelve to him, he sent them out two by two and gave them authority over evil spirits.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> These were his instructions: "Take nothing for the journey except a staff--no bread, no bag, no money in your belts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Wear sandals but not an extra tunic.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave, as a testimony against them."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> They went out and preached that people should repent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> King Herod heard about this, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some were saying, "John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Others said, "He is Elijah." And still others claimed, "He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> But when Herod heard this, he said, "John, the man I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled; yet he liked to listen to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, "Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> And he promised her with an oath, "Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> She went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?" "The head of John the Baptist," she answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> On hearing of this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> The apostles gathered round Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, "Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> But many who saw them leaving recognised them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. "This is a remote place," they said, "and it's already very late.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Send the people away so that they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> But he answered, "You give them something to eat." They said to him, "That would take eight months of a man's wages! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> "How many loaves do you have?" he asked. "Go and see." When they found out, they said, "Five--and two fish."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> They all ate and were satisfied,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> because they all saw him and were terrified. Immediately he spoke to them and said, "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognised Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55"> They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56"> And wherever he went--into villages, towns or countryside-- they placed the sick in the market-places. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched him were healed.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered round Jesus and</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were "unclean", that is, unwashed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> (The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> When they come from the market-place they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles.) </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, "Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with`unclean' hands?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> He replied, "Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: "`These people honour me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And he said to them: "You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> For Moses said,`Honour your father and your mother,' and,`Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> But you say that if a man says to his father or mother:`Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban' (that is, a gift devoted to God),</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen to me, everyone, and understand this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Nothing outside a man can make him`unclean' by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him`unclean'."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> "Are you so dull?" he asked. "Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him`unclean'?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body." (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods "clean".)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> He went on: "What comes out of a man is what makes him`unclean'.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> All these evils come from inside and make a man`unclean'."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an evil spirit came and fell at his feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> "First let the children eat all they want," he told her, "for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> "Yes, Lord," she replied, "but even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Then he told her, "For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged him to place his hand on the man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spat and touched the man's tongue.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, "Ephphatha!" (which means, "Be opened!").</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> People were overwhelmed with amazement. "He has done everything well," they said. "He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> During those days another large crowd gathered. Since they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him and said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> "I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> If I send them home hungry, they will collapse on the way, because some of them have come a long distance."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> His disciples answered, "But where in this remote place can anyone get enough bread to feed them?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> "How many loaves do you have?" Jesus asked. "Seven," they replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. When he had taken the seven loaves and given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people, and they did so.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> They had a few small fish as well; he gave thanks for them also and told the disciples to distribute them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> The people ate and were satisfied. Afterwards the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> About four thousand men were present. And having sent them away,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> The Pharisees came and began to question Jesus. To test him, they asked him for a sign from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> He sighed deeply and said, "Why does this generation ask for a miraculous sign? I tell you the truth, no sign will be given to it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Then he left them, got back into the boat and crossed to the other side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> The disciples had forgotten to bring bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> "Be careful," Jesus warned them. "Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and that of Herod."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> They discussed this with one another and said, "It is because we have no bread."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them: "Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear? And don't you remember?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?" "Twelve," they replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> "And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?" They answered, "Seven."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> He said to them, "Do you still not understand?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> They came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spat on the man's eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, "Do you see anything?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> He looked up and said, "I see people; they look like trees walking around."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Once more Jesus put his hands on the man's eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Jesus sent him home, saying, "Don't go into the village." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked them, "Who do people say I am?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> "But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?" Peter answered, "You are the Christ." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> He spoke plainly about this, and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter. "Get behind me, Satan!" he said. "You do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me and for the gospel will save it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his Father's glory with the holy angels."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> And he said to them, "I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> After six days Jesus took Peter, James and John with him and led them up a high mountain, where they were all alone. There he was transfigured before them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses, who were talking with Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters--one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> (He did not know what to say, they were so frightened.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Then a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and a voice came from the cloud: "This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Suddenly, when they looked round, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> They kept the matter to themselves, discussing what "rising from the dead" meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> And they asked him, "Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Jesus replied, "To be sure, Elijah does come first, and restores all things. Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they have done to him everything they wished, just as it is written about him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran to greet him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> "What are you arguing with them about?" he asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> A man in the crowd answered, "Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit, but they could not."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> "O unbelieving generation," Jesus replied, "how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> So they brought him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Jesus asked the boy's father, "How long has he been like this?" "From childhood," he answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> "It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> "`If you can'?" said Jesus. "Everything is possible for him who believes."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Immediately the boy's father exclaimed, "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the evil spirit. "You deaf and mute spirit," he said, "I command you, come out of him and never enter him again."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, "He's dead."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> He replied, "This kind can come out only by prayer." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, "What were you arguing about on the road?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, "If anyone wants to be first, he must be the very last, and the servant of all."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> He took a little child and had him stand among them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> "Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> "Teacher," said John, "we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop, because he was not one of us."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> "Do not stop him," Jesus said. "No-one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> for whoever is not against us is for us.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> I tell you the truth, anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to Christ will certainly not lose his reward.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> "And if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around his neck.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> where "`their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> Everyone will be salted with fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> "Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with each other."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him, and as was his custom, he taught them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> "What did Moses command you?" he replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> They said, "Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> "It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law," Jesus replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> "But at the beginning of creation God`made them male and female'.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> `For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> and the two will become one flesh.' So they are no longer two, but one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> He answered, "Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> People were bringing little children to Jesus to have him touch them, but the disciples rebuked them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> And he took the children in his arms, put his hands on them and blessed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. "Good teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> "Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No-one is good-- except God alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> You know the commandments:`Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honour your father and mother.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> "Teacher," he declared, "all these I have kept since I was a boy."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Jesus looked at him and loved him. "One thing you lack," he said. "Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> At this the man's face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, "Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, "Who then can be saved?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Peter said to him, "We have left everything to follow you!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> "I tell you the truth," Jesus replied, "no-one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age (homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields--and with them, persecutions) and in the age to come, eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> But many who are first will be last, and the last first."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. Again he took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> "We are going up to Jerusalem," he said, "and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. "Teacher," they said, "we want you to do for us whatever we ask."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> They replied, "Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> "You don't know what you are asking," Jesus said. "Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptised with the baptism I am baptised with?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> "We can," they answered. Jesus said to them, "You will drink the cup I drink and be baptised with the baptism I am baptised with,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> Jesus called them together and said, "You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (that is, the Son of Timaeus), was sitting by the roadside begging.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> Jesus stopped and said, "Call him." So they called to the blind man, "Cheer up! On your feet! He's calling you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> "What do you want me to do for you?" Jesus asked him. The blind man said, "Rabbi, I want to see."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> "Go," said Jesus, "your faith has healed you." Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> saying to them, "Go to the village ahead of you, and just as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no-one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> If anyone asks you,`Why are you doing this?' tell him,`The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> They went and found a colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway. As they untied it,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> some people standing there asked, "What are you doing, untying that colt?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> They answered as Jesus had told them to, and the people let them go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut in the fields.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, "Hosanna!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> "Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!" "Hosanna in the highest!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Jesus entered Jerusalem and went to the temple. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Seeing in the distance a fig-tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Then he said to the tree, "May no-one ever eat fruit from you again." And his disciples heard him say it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple area and began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money-changers and the benches of those selling doves,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And as he taught them, he said, "Is it not written: "`My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations'? But you have made it`a den of robbers'."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> When evening came, they went out of the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig-tree withered from the roots.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Peter remembered and said to Jesus, "Rabbi, look! The fig-tree you cursed has withered!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> "Have faith in God," Jesus answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> "I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain,`Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> They arrived again in Jerusalem, and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders came to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> "By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you authority to do this?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Jesus replied, "I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> John's baptism--was it from heaven, or from men? Tell me!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say,`From heaven', he will ask,`Then why didn't you believe him?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> But if we say,`From men'...." (They feared the people, for everyone held that John really was a prophet.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> He then began to speak to them in parables: "A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> But they seized him, beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Then he sent another servant to them; they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> He sent still another, and that one they killed. He sent many others; some of them they beat, others they killed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> "He had one left to send, a son, whom he loved. He sent him last of all, saying,`They will respect my son.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> "But the tenants said to one another,`This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> So they took him and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> "What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Haven't you read this scripture: "`The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone; </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> the Lord has done this, and it is marvellous in our eyes'?" </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Then they looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them. But they were afraid of the crowd; so they left him and went away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in his words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> They came to him and said, "Teacher, we know you are a man of integrity. You aren't swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are; but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Should we pay or shouldn't we?" But Jesus knew their hypocrisy. "Why are you trying to trap me?" he asked. "Bring me a denarius and let me look at it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> They brought the coin, and he asked them, "Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?" "Caesar's," they replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Then Jesus said to them, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's." And they were amazed at him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> "Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving any children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> The second one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child. It was the same with the third.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> In fact, none of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> At the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Jesus replied, "Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Now about the dead rising--have you not read in the book of Moses, in the account of the bush, how God said to him,`I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, "Of all the commandments, which is the most important?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> "The most important one," answered Jesus, "is this:`Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> The second is this:`Love your neighbour as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> "Well said, teacher," the man replied. "You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbour as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." And from then on no-one dared ask him any more questions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, "How is it that the teachers of the law say that the Christ is the son of David?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: "`The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet."' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> David himself calls him`Lord'. How then can he be his son?" The large crowd listened to him with delight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> As he taught, Jesus said, "Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted in the market-places,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honour at banquets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Such men will be punished most severely."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a fraction of a penny.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything--all she had to live on."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> As he was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Look, Teacher! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> "Do you see all these great buildings?" replied Jesus. "Not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John and Andrew asked him privately,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Jesus said to them: "Watch out that no-one deceives you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Many will come in my name, claiming,`I am he,' and will deceive many.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> When you hear of wars and rumours of wars, do not be alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines. These are the beginning of birth-pains.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> "You must be on your guard. You will be handed over to the local councils and flogged in the synagogues. On account of me you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And the gospel must first be preached to all nations.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Whenever you are arrested and brought to trial, do not worry beforehand about what to say. Just say whatever is given you at the time, for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> "Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> All men will hate you because of me, but he who stands firm to the end will be saved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> "When you see`the abomination that causes desolation' standing where it does not belong--let the reader understand--then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Let no-one on the roof of his house go down or enter the house to take anything out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Let no-one in the field go back to get his cloak.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Pray that this will not take place in winter,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> because those will be days of distress unequalled from the beginning, when God created the world, until now--and never to be equalled again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> If the Lord had not cut short those days, no-one would survive. But for the sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has shortened them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> At that time if anyone says to you,`Look, here is the Christ!' or,`Look, there he is!' do not believe it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and miracles to deceive the elect--if that were possible.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> So be on your guard; I have told you everything ahead of time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> "But in those days, following that distress, "`the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> "At that time men will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> "Now learn this lesson from the fig-tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that it is near, right at the door.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> "No-one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> Be on guard! Be alert! You do not know when that time will come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> It's like a man going away: He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge, each with his assigned task, and tells the one at the door to keep watch.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> "Therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come back--whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the cock crows, or at dawn.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were only two days away, and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some sly way to arrest Jesus and kill him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> "But not during the Feast," they said, "or the people may riot."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> While he was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, "Why this waste of perfume?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> It could have been sold for more than a year's wages and the money given to the poor." And they rebuked her harshly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> "Leave her alone," said Jesus. "Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> I tell you the truth, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus' disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, "Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Say to the owner of the house he enters,`The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> The disciples left, went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me--one who is eating with me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> They were saddened, and one by one they said to him, "Surely not I?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> "It is one of the Twelve," he replied, "one who dips bread into the bowl with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take it; this is my body."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, and they all drank from it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> "This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many," he said to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> "I tell you the truth, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> "You will all fall away," Jesus told them, "for it is written: "`I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Peter declared, "Even if all fall away, I will not."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "today--yes, tonight--before the cock crows twice you yourself will disown me three times."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> But Peter insisted emphatically, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you." And all the others said the same.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death," he said to them. "Stay here and keep watch."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> "Abba, Father," he said, "everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Simon," he said to Peter, "are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> Once more he went away and prayed the same thing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> Returning the third time, he said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Rabbi!" and kissed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> The men seized Jesus and arrested him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> "Am I leading a rebellion," said Jesus, "that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> Then everyone deserted him and fled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders and teachers of the law came together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55"> The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56"> Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57"> Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58"> "We heard him say,`I will destroy this man-made temple and in three days will build another, not made by man.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59"> Yet even then their testimony did not agree.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60"> Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, "Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61"> But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62"> "I am," said Jesus. "And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63"> The high priest tore his clothes. "Why do we need any more witnesses?" he asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64"> "You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?" They all condemned him as worthy of death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65"> Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, "Prophesy!" And the guards took him and beat him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66"> While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67"> When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him. "You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus," she said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="68"> But he denied it. "I don't know or understand what you're talking about," he said, and went out into the entrance. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="69"> When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, "This fellow is one of them."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="70"> Again he denied it. After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="71"> He began to call down curses on himself, and he swore to them, "I don't know this man you're talking about."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="72"> Immediately the cock crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: "Before the cock crows twice you will disown me three times." And he broke down and wept.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="15">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin, reached a decision. They bound Jesus, led him away and turned him over to Pilate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> "Are you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate. "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> The chief priests accused him of many things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> So again Pilate asked him, "Aren't you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Now it was the custom at the Feast to release a prisoner whom the people requested.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> "Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> knowing it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> "What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?" Pilate asked them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> "Crucify him!" they shouted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> "Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called together the whole company of soldiers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And they began to call out to him, "Hail, king of the Jews!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spat on him. Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull).</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> It was the third hour when they crucified him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> The written notice of the charge against him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> They crucified two robbers with him, one on his right and one on his left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, "So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> come down from the cross and save yourself!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves. "He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Let this Christ, this King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe." Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> At the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?"--which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> When some of those standing near heard this, they said, "Listen, he's calling Elijah."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> One man ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. "Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down," he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, heard his cry and saw how he died, he said, "Surely this man was the Son of God!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="16">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus' body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on their way to the tomb</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> and they asked each other, "Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> "Don't be alarmed," he said. "You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> But go, tell his disciples and Peter,`He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> When Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had driven seven demons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> She went and told those who had been with him and who were mourning and weeping.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> When they heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him, they did not believe it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Afterwards Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking in the country.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> These returned and reported it to the rest; but they did not believe them either.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating; he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Whoever believes and is baptised will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and he sat at the right hand of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that accompanied it.</VERS>

	<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="42" bname="Luke">
		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eye-witnesses and servants of the word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Both of them were upright in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commandments and regulations blamelessly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren; and they were both well on in years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Once when Zechariah's division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshippers were praying outside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> But the angel said to him: "Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from birth. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord their God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous--to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Zechariah asked the angel, "How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well on in years."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> The angel answered, "I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their proper time."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realised he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> When his time of service was completed, he returned home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> "The Lord has done this for me," she said. "In these days he has shown his favour and taken away my disgrace among the people."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> The angel went to her and said, "Greetings, you who are highly favoured! The Lord is with you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> But the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favour with God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> and he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever; his kingdom will never end."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> "How will this be," Mary asked the angel, "since I am a virgin?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be barren is in her sixth month.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> For nothing is impossible with God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> "I am the Lord's servant," Mary answered. "May it be to me as you have said." Then the angel left her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> In a loud voice she exclaimed: "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> But why am I so favoured, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> Blessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> And Mary said: "My soul glorifies the Lord</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on all generations will call me blessed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> for the Mighty One has done great things for me--holy is his name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> His mercy extends to those who fear him, from generation to generation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55"> to Abraham and his descendants for ever, even as he said to our fathers."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56"> Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57"> When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58"> Her neighbours and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59"> On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60"> but his mother spoke up and said, "No! He is to be called John."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61"> They said to her, "There is no-one among your relatives who has that name."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62"> Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63"> He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone's astonishment he wrote, "His name is John."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64"> Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue was loosed, and he began to speak, praising God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65"> The neighbours were all filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea people were talking about all these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66"> Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, "What then is this child going to be?" For the Lord's hand was with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67"> His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="68"> "Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come and has redeemed his people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="69"> He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="70"> (as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="71"> salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="72"> to show mercy to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="73"> the oath he swore to our father Abraham:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="74"> to rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and to enable us to serve him without fear</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="75"> in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="76"> And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="77"> to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="78"> because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="79"> to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of peace."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="80"> And the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the desert until he appeared publicly to Israel.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> (This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And everyone went to his own town to register.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> And there were shepherds living out in the fields near by, keeping watch over their flocks at night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Today in the town of David a Saviour has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on whom his favour rests."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise him, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he had been conceived.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> When the time of their purification according to the Law of Moses had been completed, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, "Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord"), </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord: "a pair of doves or two young pigeons". </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> "Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you now dismiss your servant in peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> For my eyes have seen your salvation,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> which you have prepared in the sight of all people,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> The child's father and mother marvelled at what was said about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: "This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> There was also a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> and then was a widow until she was eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshipped night and day, fasting and praying.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> When he was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast, according to the custom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> After the Feast was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> Thinking he was in their company, they travelled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> "Why were you searching for me?" he asked. "Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> But they did not understand what he was saying to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and men.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar-- when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the desert.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> As is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: "A voice of one calling in the desert,`Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And all mankind will see God's salvation.'" </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> John said to the crowds coming out to be baptised by him, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves,`We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> The axe is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> "What should we do then?" the crowd asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> John answered, "The man with two tunics should share with him who has none, and the one who has food should do the same."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Tax collectors also came to be baptised. "Teacher," they asked, "what should we do?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> "Don't collect any more than you are required to," he told them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Then some soldiers asked him, "And what should we do?" He replied, "Don't extort money and don't accuse people falsely-- be content with your pay."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Christ. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> John answered them all, "I baptise you with water. But one more powerful than I will come, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing-floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> And with many other words John exhorted the people and preached the good news to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other evil things he had done,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Herod added this to them all: He locked John up in prison.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> When all the people were being baptised, Jesus was baptised too. And as he was praying, heaven was opened</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the desert,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing during those days, and at the end of them he was hungry.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> The devil said to him, "If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Jesus answered, "It is written:`Man does not live on bread alone.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And he said to him, "I will give you all their authority and splendour, for it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> So if you worship me, it will all be yours."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Jesus answered, "It is written:`Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. "If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down from here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> For it is written: "`He will command his angels concerning you to guard you carefully;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'" </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Jesus answered, "It says:`Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> When the devil had finished all this tempting, he left him until an opportune time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> He taught in their synagogues, and everyone praised him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. And he stood up to read.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> "The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to release the oppressed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> to proclaim the year of the Lord's favour." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> and he began by saying to them, "Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. "Isn't this Joseph's son?" they asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Jesus said to them, "Surely you will quote this proverb to me:`Physician, heal yourself! Do here in your home town what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> "I tell you the truth," he continued, "no prophet is accepted in his home town.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah's time, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed--only Naaman the Syrian."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him down the cliff.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath began to teach the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> They were amazed at his teaching, because his message had authority.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> In the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon, an evil spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> "Ha! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> "Be quiet!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!" Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> All the people were amazed and said to each other, "What is this teaching? With authority and power he gives orders to evil spirits and they come out!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began to wait on them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> When the sun was setting, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, "You are the Son of God!" But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew he was the Christ. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> At daybreak Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> But he said, "I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> And he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea. </VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, with the people crowding round him and listening to the word of God,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> he saw at the water's edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Simon answered, "Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> So they signalled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus' knees and said, "Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon's partners. Then Jesus said to Simon, "Don't be afraid; from now on you will catch men."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground and begged him, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" And immediately the leprosy left him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Then Jesus ordered him, "Don't tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> One day as he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law, who had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem, were sitting there. And the power of the Lord was present for him to heal the sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Some men came carrying a paralytic on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> When Jesus saw their faith, he said, "Friend, your sins are forgiven."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, "Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Which is easier: to say,`Your sins are forgiven,' or to say,`Get up and walk'?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...." He said to the paralysed man, "I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on and went home praising God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God. They were filled with awe and said, "We have seen remarkable things today."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. "Follow me," Jesus said to him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> and Levi got up, left everything and followed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and`sinners'?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Jesus answered them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> They said to him, "John's disciples often fast and pray, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go on eating and drinking."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Jesus answered, "Can you make the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; in those days they will fast."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> He told them this parable: "No-one tears a patch from a new garment and sews it on an old one. If he does, he will have torn the new garment, and the patch from the new will not match the old.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> And no-one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins, the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> And no-one after drinking old wine wants the new, for he says,`The old is better.'"</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> One Sabbath Jesus was going through the cornfields, and his disciples began to pick some ears of corn, rub them in their hands and eat the grain.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Some of the Pharisees asked, "Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Jesus answered them, "Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> He entered the house of God, and taking the consecrated bread, he ate what is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was shrivelled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shrivelled hand, "Get up and stand in front of everyone." So he got up and stood there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Then Jesus said to them, "I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> He looked round at them all, and then said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did so, and his hand was completely restored.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> But they were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the coast of Tyre and Sidon,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by evil spirits were cured,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing them all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Looking at his disciples, he said: "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> "Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven. For that is how their fathers treated the prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> "But woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Woe to you who are well fed now, for you will go hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false prophets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> "But I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> bless those who curse you, pray for those who ill-treat you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also. If someone takes your cloak, do not stop him from taking your tunic.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Do to others as you would have them do to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> "If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even`sinners' love those who love them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even`sinners' do that.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even`sinners' lend to`sinners', expecting to be repaid in full.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> "Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> He also told them this parable: "Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> A student is not above his teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> "Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> How can you say to your brother,`Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,' when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> "No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> Each tree is recognised by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thorn-bushes, or grapes from briers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For out of the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> "Why do you call me,`Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> I will show you what he is like who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When the flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> When Jesus had finished saying all this in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> There a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, "This man deserves to have you do this,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> So Jesus went with them. He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him: "Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one,`Go', and he goes; and that one,`Come', and he comes. I say to my servant,`Do this', and he does it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, "I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Soon afterwards, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out--the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, "Don't cry."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Then he went up and touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still. He said, "Young man, I say to you, get up!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> They were all filled with awe and praised God. "A great prophet has appeared among us," they said. "God has come to help his people."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> John's disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> he sent them to the Lord to ask, "Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> When the men came to Jesus, they said, "John the Baptist sent us to you to ask,`Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> So he replied to the messengers, "Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> After John's messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: "What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> This is the one about whom it is written: "`I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> I tell you, among those born of women there is no-one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> (All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus' words, acknowledged that God's way was right, because they had been baptised by John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> But the Pharisees and experts in the law rejected God's purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptised by John.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> "To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> They are like children sitting in the market-place and calling out to each other: "`We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say,`He has a demon.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say,`Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and "sinners".'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> But wisdom is proved right by all her children."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Now one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went to the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> When a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> and as she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is--that she is a sinner."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have something to tell you." "Tell me, teacher," he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> "Two men owed money to a certain money-lender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he cancelled the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> Simon replied, "I suppose the one who had the bigger debt cancelled." "You have judged correctly," Jesus said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> Then he turned towards the woman and said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven-- for she loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> Then Jesus said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> The other guests began to say among themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> Jesus said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> After this, Jesus travelled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Joanna the wife of Chuza, the manager of Herod's household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> "A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds of the air ate it up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Some fell on rock, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown." When he said this, he called out, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> His disciples asked him what this parable meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> He said, "The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, "`though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> "This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life's worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> "No-one lights a lamp and hides it in a jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, he puts it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken from him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Now Jesus' mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> He replied, "My mother and brothers are those who hear God's word and put it into practice."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> One day Jesus said to his disciples, "Let's go over to the other side of the lake." So they got into a boat and set out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> The disciples went and woke him, saying, "Master, Master, we're going to drown!" He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> "Where is your faith?" he asked his disciples. In fear and amazement they asked one another, "Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don't torture me!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> For Jesus had commanded the evil spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" "Legion," he replied, because many demons had gone into him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> And they begged him repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into them, and he gave them permission.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> "Return home and tell how much God has done for you." So the man went away and told all over the town how much Jesus had done for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> Then a man named Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come to his house</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no-one could heal her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> "Who touched me?" Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, "Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> But Jesus said, "Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> Then he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. "Your daughter is dead," he said. "Don't bother the teacher any more."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, "Don't be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child's father and mother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. "Stop wailing," Jesus said. "She is not dead but asleep."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> But he took her by the hand and said, "My child, get up!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55"> Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56"> Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> He told them: "Take nothing for the journey--no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra tunic.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> If people do not welcome you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave their town, as a testimony against them."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> So they set out and went from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing people everywhere.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he was perplexed, because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> But Herod said, "I beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such things about?" And he tried to see him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said, "Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> He replied, "You give them something to eat." They answered, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish-- unless we go and buy food for all this crowd."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> (About five thousand men were there.) But he said to his disciples, "Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> The disciples did so, and everybody sat down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to set before the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, "Who do the crowds say I am?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> "But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?" Peter answered, "The Christ of God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And he said, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Then he said to them all: "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit his very self?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Two men, Moses and Elijah,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> appeared in glorious splendour, talking with Jesus. They spoke about his departure, which he was about to bring to fulfilment at Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, "Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters-- one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah." (He did not know what he was saying.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> A voice came from the cloud, saying, "This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> When the voice had spoken, they found that Jesus was alone. The disciples kept this to themselves, and told no-one at that time what they had seen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> A man in the crowd called out, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they could not."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> "O unbelieving and perverse generation," Jesus replied, "how long shall I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son here."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the evil spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> And they were all amazed at the greatness of God. While everyone was marvelling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> "Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you: The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> But they did not understand what this meant. It was hidden from them, so that they did not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> An argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a little child and made him stand beside him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> Then he said to them, "Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For he who is least among you all--he is the greatest."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> "Master," said John, "we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> "Do not stop him," Jesus said, "for whoever is not against you is for you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> And he sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> but the people there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, "Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them?" </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55"> But Jesus turned and rebuked them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56"> and they went to another village.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57"> As they were walking along the road, a man said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58"> Jesus replied, "Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59"> He said to another man, "Follow me." But the man replied, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60"> Jesus said to him, "Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61"> Still another said, "I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say good-bye to my family."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62"> Jesus replied, "No-one who puts his hand to the plough and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> He told them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Do not take a purse or bag or sandals; and do not greet anyone on the road.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> "When you enter a house, first say,`Peace to this house.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> If a man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; if not, it will return to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Stay in that house, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> "When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is set before you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Heal the sick who are there and tell them,`The kingdom of God is near you.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> `Even the dust of your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this: The kingdom of God is near.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> "Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the skies? No, you will go down to the depths. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> "He who listens to you listens to me; he who rejects you rejects me; but he who rejects me rejects him who sent me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> The seventy-two returned with joy and said, "Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> He replied, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> "All things have been committed to me by my Father. No-one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no-one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, "Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. "Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> "What is written in the Law?" he replied. "How do you read it?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> He answered: "`Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and,`Love your neighbour as yourself.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> "You have answered correctly," Jesus replied. "Do this and you will live."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbour?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> In reply Jesus said: "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half-dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> But a Samaritan, as he travelled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper.`Look after him,' he said,`and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> "Which of these three do you think was a neighbour to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> The expert in the law replied, "The one who had mercy on him." Jesus told him, "Go and do likewise."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, "Lord, don't you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> "Martha, Martha," the Lord answered, "you are worried and upset about many things,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> but only one thing is needed. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="11">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> He said to them, "When you pray, say: "`Father, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Give us each day our daily bread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against us. And lead us not into temptation.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Then he said to them, "Suppose one of you has a friend, and he goes to him at midnight and says,`Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> because a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have nothing to set before him.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> "Then the one inside answers,`Don't bother me. The door is already locked, and my children are with me in bed. I can't get up and give you anything.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> I tell you, though he will not get up and give him the bread because he is his friend, yet because of the man's boldness he will get up and give him as much as he needs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> "So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> "Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon left, the man who had been mute spoke, and the crowd was amazed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> But some of them said, "By Beelzebub, the prince of demons, he is driving out demons."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Others tested him by asking for a sign from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them: "Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? I say this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebub.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your followers drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> "When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are safe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armour in which the man trusted and divides up the spoils.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> "He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me, scatters.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> "When an evil spirit comes out of a man, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says,`I will return to the house I left.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that man is worse than the first."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out, "Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> He replied, "Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> As the crowds increased, Jesus said, "This is a wicked generation. It asks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and now one greater than Solomon is here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> "No-one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden, or under a bowl. Instead he puts it on its stand, so that those who come in may see the light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are good, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are bad, your body also is full of darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark, it will be completely lighted, as when the light of a lamp shines on you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> When Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him; so he went in and reclined at the table.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> But the Pharisee, noticing that Jesus did not first wash before the meal, was surprised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> Then the Lord said to him, "Now then, you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> You foolish people! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Jesus answered, "Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="5"> I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Then he told this parable: "A man had a fig-tree, planted in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it, but did not find any.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard,`For three years now I've been coming to look for fruit on this fig-tree and haven't found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> "`Sir,' the man replied,`leave it alone for one more year, and I'll dig round it and fertilise it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, "Woman, you are set free from your infirmity."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Then he put his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue ruler said to the people, "There are six days for work. So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> The Lord answered him, "You hypocrites! Doesn't each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Then Jesus asked, "What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I compare it to?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air perched in its branches."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Again he asked, "What shall I compare the kingdom of God to?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it worked all through the dough."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Then Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he made his way to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Someone asked him, "Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?" He said to them,</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="31"> At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him, "Leave this place and go somewhere else. Herod wants to kill you."</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="14">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent Pharisee, he was being carefully watched.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> There in front of him was a man suffering from dropsy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, he healed him and sent him away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Then he asked them, "If one of you has a son or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull him out?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And they had nothing to say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honour at the table, he told them this parable:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> "When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honour, for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you,`Give this man your seat.' Then, humiliated, you will have to take the least important place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> But when you are invited, take the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he will say to you,`Friend, move up to a better place.' Then you will be honoured in the presence of all your fellow guests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Then Jesus said to his host, "When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or relatives, or your rich neighbours; if you do, they may invite you back and so you will be repaid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus, "Blessed is the man who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Jesus replied: "A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited,`Come, for everything is now ready.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> "But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said,`I have just bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> "Another said,`I have just bought five yoke of oxen, and I'm on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> "Still another said,`I have just got married, so I can't come.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> "The servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant,`Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> "`Sir,' the servant said,`what you ordered has been done, but there is still room.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> "Then the master told his servant,`Go out to the roads and country lanes and make them come in, so that my house will be full.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> I tell you, not one of those men who were invited will get a taste of my banquet.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Large crowds were travelling with Jesus, and turning to them he said:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> "If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters--yes, even his own life--he cannot be my disciple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And anyone who does not carry his cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> "Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Will he not first sit down and estimate the cost to see if he has enough money to complete it?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> For if he lays the foundation and is not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> saying,`This fellow began to build and was not able to finish.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> "Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Will he not first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> In the same way, any of you who does not give up everything he has cannot be my disciple.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> "Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again?</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now the tax collectors and "sinners" were all gathering round to hear him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, "This man welcomes sinners, and eats with them."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Then Jesus told them this parable:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> "Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Does he not leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbours together and says,`Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> "Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Does she not light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbours together and says,`Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Jesus continued: "There was a man who had two sons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> The younger one said to his father,`Father, give me my share of the estate.' So he divided his property between them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> "Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no-one gave him anything.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> "When he came to his senses, he said,`How many of my father's hired men have food to spare, and here I am starving to death!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired men.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> So he got up and went to his father. "But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> "The son said to him,`Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> "But the father said to his servants,`Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Jesus said to his disciples: "Things that cause people to sin are bound to come, but woe to that person through whom they come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> It would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied round his neck than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> So watch yourselves. "If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> If he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times comes back to you and says,`I repent,' forgive him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> He replied, "If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree,`Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it will obey you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> "Suppose one of you had a servant ploughing or looking after the sheep. Would he say to the servant when he comes in from the field,`Come along now and sit down to eat'?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Would he not rather say,`Prepare my supper, get yourself ready and wait on me while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink'?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Would he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say,`We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus travelled along the border between Samaria and Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met him. They stood at a distance</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> and called out in a loud voice, "Jesus, Master, have pity on us!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> When he saw them, he said, "Go, show yourselves to the priests." And as they went, they were cleansed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> He threw himself at Jesus' feet and thanked him--and he was a Samaritan.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Jesus asked, "Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Was no-one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Then he said to him, "Rise and go; your faith has made you well."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Once, having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, "The kingdom of God does not come with your careful observation,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> nor will people say,`Here it is,' or`There it is,' because the kingdom of God is within you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Then he said to his disciples, "The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Men will tell you,`There he is!' or`Here he is!' Do not go running off after them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> For the Son of Man in his day will be like the lightning, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="26"> "Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> "It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulphur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> "It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> On that day no-one who is on the roof of his house, with his goods inside, should go down to get them. Likewise, no-one in the field should go back for anything.</VERS>

		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> He said: "In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared about men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea,`Grant me justice against my adversary.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> "For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself,`Even though I don't fear God or care about men,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won't eventually wear me out with her coming!'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> And the Lord said, "Listen to what the unjust judge says.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else, Jesus told this parable:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> "Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself:`God, I thank you that I am not like other men--robbers, evildoers, adulterers--or even like this tax collector.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> "But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said,`God, have mercy on me, a sinner.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> "I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> People were also bringing babies to Jesus to have him touch them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> But Jesus called the children to him and said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> A certain ruler asked him, "Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> "Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No-one is good-- except God alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> You know the commandments:`Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honour your father and mother.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> "All these I have kept since I was a boy," he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> When Jesus heard this, he said to him, "You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was a man of great wealth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Jesus looked at him and said, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Those who heard this asked, "Who then can be saved?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Jesus replied, "What is impossible with men is possible with God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Peter said to him, "We have left all we had to follow you!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> "I tell you the truth," Jesus said to them, "no-one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> will fail to receive many times as much in this age and, in the age to come, eternal life."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them, "We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> He will be turned over to the Gentiles. They will mock him, insult him, spit on him, flog him and kill him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> On the third day he will rise again."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> The disciples did not understand any of this. Its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> They told him, "Jesus of Nazareth is passing by."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> He called out, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> "What do you want me to do for you?" "Lord, I want to see," he replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight; your faith has healed you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they also praised God.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> He wanted to see who Jesus was, but being a short man he could not, because of the crowd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> All the people saw this and began to mutter, "He has gone to be the guest of a`sinner'."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, "Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> While they were listening to this, he went on to tell them a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> He said: "A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas.`Put this money to work,' he said,`until I come back.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> "But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say,`We don't want this man to be our king.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> "He was made king, however, and returned home. Then he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money, in order to find out what they had gained with it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> "The first one came and said,`Sir, your mina has earned ten more.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> "`Well done, my good servant!' his master replied.`Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> "The second came and said,`Sir, your mina has earned five more.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> "His master answered,`You take charge of five cities.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> "Then another servant came and said,`Sir, here is your mina; I have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> "His master replied,`I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant! You knew, did you, that I am a hard man, taking out what I did not put in, and reaping what I did not sow?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Why then didn't you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected it with interest?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> "Then he said to those standing by,`Take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> "`Sir,' they said,`he already has ten!'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> "He replied,`I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but as for the one who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be a king over them--bring them here and kill them in front of me.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> After Jesus had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> "Go to the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no-one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> If anyone asks you,`Why are you untying it?' tell him,`The Lord needs it.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Those who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, "Why are you untying the colt?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> They replied, "The Lord needs it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> They brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> As he went along, people spread their cloaks on the road.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> When he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> "Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!" "Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, "Teacher, rebuke your disciples!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> "I tell you," he replied, "if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> and said, "If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace--but now it is hidden from your eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognise the time of God's coming to you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> Then he entered the temple area and began driving out those who were selling.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> "It is written," he said to them, "`My house will be a house of prayer'; but you have made it`a den of robbers'."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> Every day he was teaching at the temple. But the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the leaders among the people were trying to kill him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> Yet they could not find any way to do it, because all the people hung on his words.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> One day as he was teaching the people in the temple courts and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, together with the elders, came up to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> "Tell us by what authority you are doing these things," they said. "Who gave you this authority?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> He replied, "I will also ask you a question. Tell me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> John's baptism--was it from heaven, or from men?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say,`From heaven', he will ask,`Why didn't you believe him?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> But if we say,`From men', all the people will stone us, because they are persuaded that John was a prophet."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> So they answered, "We don't know where it was from."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> He went on to tell the people this parable: "A man planted a vineyard, rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> He sent another servant, but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> "Then the owner of the vineyard said,`What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> "But when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over.`This is the heir,' they said.`Let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. "What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others." When the people heard this, they said, "May this never be!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Jesus looked directly at them and asked, "Then what is the meaning of that which is written: "`The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone'?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Keeping a close watch on him, they sent spies, who pretended to be honest. They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> So the spies questioned him: "Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> He saw through their duplicity and said to them,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> "Show me a denarius. Whose portrait and inscription are on it?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> "Caesar's," they replied. He said to them, "Then give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> They were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public. And astonished by his answer, they became silent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> "Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> The second</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> and then the third married her, and in the same way the seven died, leaving no children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Finally, the woman died too.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> Now then, at the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Jesus replied, "The people of this age marry and are given in marriage.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> But those who are considered worthy of taking part in that age and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God's children, since they are children of the resurrection.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> But in the account of the bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord`the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> Some of the teachers of the law responded, "Well said, teacher!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> And no-one dared to ask him any more questions.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> Then Jesus said to them, "How is it that they say the Christ is the Son of David?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> David himself declares in the Book of Psalms: "`The Lord said to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> David calls him`Lord'. How then can he be his son?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> While all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> "Beware of the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted in the market-places and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honour at banquets.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Such men will be punished most severely."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> As he looked up, Jesus saw the rich putting their gifts into the temple treasury.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> He also saw a poor widow put in two very small copper coins. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> "I tell you the truth," he said, "this poor widow has put in more than all the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> All these people gave their gifts out of their wealth; but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Some of his disciples were remarking about how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and with gifts dedicated to God. But Jesus said,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> "As for what you see here, the time will come when not one stone will be left on another; every one of them will be thrown down."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> "Teacher," they asked, "when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> He replied: "Watch out that you are not deceived. For many will come in my name, claiming,`I am he,' and`The time is near.' Do not follow them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> When you hear of wars and revolutions, do not be frightened. These things must happen first, but the end will not come right away."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Then he said to them: "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> There will be great earthquakes, famines and pestilences in various places, and fearful events and great signs from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> "But before all this, they will lay hands on you and persecute you. They will deliver you to synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors, and all on account of my name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> This will result in your being witnesses to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> But make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers, relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> All men will hate you because of me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> But not a hair of your head will perish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> By standing firm you will gain life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> "When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country not enter the city.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> For this is the time of punishment in fulfilment of all that has been written.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! There will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> They will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> "There will be signs in the sun, moon and stars. On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="28"> When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> He told them this parable: "Look at the fig-tree and all the trees.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that the kingdom of God is near.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="2"> and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> They were delighted and agreed to give him money.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> "Where do you want us to prepare for it?" they asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> He replied, "As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> and say to the owner of the house,`The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> He will show you a large upper room, all furnished. Make preparations there."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> And he said to them, "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfilment in the kingdom of God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, "Take this and divide it among you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> For I tell you I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed, but woe to that man who betrays him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Also a dispute arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Jesus said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> You are those who have stood by me in my trials.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> "Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift you as wheat.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> But he replied, "Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Jesus answered, "I tell you, Peter, before the cock crows today, you will deny three times that you know me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?" "Nothing," they answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> He said to them, "But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> It is written:`And he was numbered with the transgressors'; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfilment."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> The disciples said, "See, Lord, here are two swords." "That is enough," he replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> On reaching the place, he said to them, "Pray that you will not fall into temptation."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> He withdrew about a stone's throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> "Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> "Why are you sleeping?" he asked them. "Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> but Jesus asked him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> When Jesus' followers saw what was going to happen, they said, "Lord, should we strike with our swords?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> But Jesus answered, "No more of this!" And he touched the man's ear and healed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, "Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour--when darkness reigns."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55"> But when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56"> A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, "This man was with him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57"> But he denied it. "Woman, I don't know him," he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58"> A little later someone else saw him and said, "You also are one of them." "Man, I am not!" Peter replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59"> About an hour later another asserted, "Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60"> Peter replied, "Man, I don't know what you're talking about!" Just as he was speaking, the cock crowed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61"> The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: "Before the cock crows today, you will disown me three times."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62"> And he went outside and wept bitterly.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63"> The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64"> They blindfolded him and demanded, "Prophesy! Who hit you?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65"> And they said many other insulting things to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66"> At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67"> "If you are the Christ," they said, "tell us." Jesus answered, "If I tell you, you will not believe me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="68"> and if I asked you, you would not answer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="69"> But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="70"> They all asked, "Are you then the Son of God?" He replied, "You are right in saying I am."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="71"> Then they said, "Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="23">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Then the whole assembly rose and led him off to Pilate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> And they began to accuse him, saying, "We have found this man subverting our nation. He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar and claims to be Christ, a king."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> So Pilate asked Jesus, "Are you the king of the Jews?" "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Then Pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd, "I find no basis for a charge against this man."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> But they insisted, "He stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the way here."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> When he learned that Jesus was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he hoped to see him perform some miracle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> He plied him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there, vehemently accusing him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in an elegant robe, they sent him back to Pilate.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> That day Herod and Pilate became friends--before this they had been enemies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers and the people,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> and said to them, "You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for your charges against him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us; as you can see, he has done nothing to deserve death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Therefore, I will punish him and then release him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> With one voice they cried out, "Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> (Barabbas had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> But they kept shouting, "Crucify him! Crucify him!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> For the third time he spoke to them: "Why? What crime has this man committed? I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have him punished and then release him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> But with loud shouts they insistently demanded that he be crucified, and their shouts prevailed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> So Pilate decided to grant their demand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for, and surrendered Jesus to their will.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> As they led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Jesus turned and said to them, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> For the time will come when you will say,`Blessed are the barren women, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Then "`they will say to the mountains, "Fall on us!" and to the hills "Cover us!"' </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> For if men do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Two other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be executed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> When they came to the place called the Skull, there they crucified him, along with the criminals--one on his right, the other on his left.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him. They said, "He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> and said, "If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> There was a written notice above him, which read: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: "Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> But the other criminal rebuked him. "Don't you fear God," he said, "since you are under the same sentence?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> Jesus answered him, "I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> for the sun stopped shining. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> Jesus called out with a loud voice, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit." When he had said this, he breathed his last.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> The centurion, seeing what had happened, praised God and said, "Surely this was a righteous man."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, they beat their breasts and went away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> But all those who knew him, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> who had not consented to their decision and action. He came from the Judean town of Arimathea and he was waiting for the kingdom of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock, one in which no-one had yet been laid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55"> The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56"> Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="24">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, "Why do you look for the living among the dead?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> `The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Then they remembered his words.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> but they were kept from recognising him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> He asked them, "What are you discussing together as you walk along?" They stood still, their faces downcast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, "Are you only a visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> "What things?" he asked. "About Jesus of Nazareth," they replied. "He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> but didn't find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> He said to them, "How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going further.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> But they urged him strongly, "Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over." So he went in to stay with them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Then their eyes were opened and they recognised him, and he disappeared from their sight.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> They asked each other, "Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> and saying, "It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognised by them when he broke the bread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, "Peace be with you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> He said to them, "Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> They gave him a piece of broiled fish,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> and he took it and ate it in their presence.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> He said to them, "This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> He told them, "This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> You are witnesses of these things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> Then they worshipped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God.</VERS>

	</BIBLEBOOK>
	<BIBLEBOOK bnumber="43" bname="John">
		<CHAPTER cnumber="1">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> He was with God in the beginning.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> In him was life, and that life was the light of men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognise him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> John testifies concerning him. He cries out, saying, "This was he of whom I said,`He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> From the fulness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> No-one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only, who is at the Father's side, has made him known.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, "I am not the Christ." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> They asked him, "Then who are you? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the Prophet?" He answered, "No."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Finally they said, "Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, "I am the voice of one calling in the desert,`Make straight the way for the Lord.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Now some Pharisees who had been sent</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> questioned him, "Why then do you baptise if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> "I baptise with water," John replied, "but among you stands one you do not know.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptising.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him and said, "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> This is the one I meant when I said,`A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptising with water was that he might be revealed to Israel."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Then John gave this testimony: "I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptise with water told me,`The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptise with the Holy Spirit.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> The next day John was there again with two of his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, "Look, the Lamb of God!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Turning round, Jesus saw them following and asked, "What do you want?" They said, "Rabbi" (which means Teacher), "where are you staying?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> "Come," he replied, "and you will see." So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, "We have found the Messiah" (that is, the Christ).</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas" (which, when translated, is Peter). </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, "Follow me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> Philip found Nathanael and told him, "We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> "Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?" Nathanael asked. "Come and see," said Philip.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, "Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> "How do you know me?" Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, "I saw you while you were still under the fig-tree before Philip called you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> Then Nathanael declared, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> Jesus said, "You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig-tree. You shall see greater things than that."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> He then added, "I tell you the truth, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="2">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> When the wine was gone, Jesus' mother said to him, "They have no more wine."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> "Dear woman, why do you involve me?" Jesus replied. "My time has not yet come."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> His mother said to the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Jesus said to the servants, "Fill the jars with water"; so they filled them to the brim.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Then he told them, "Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet." They did so,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realise where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> and said, "Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> This, the first of his miraculous signs, Jesus performed at Cana in Galilee. He thus revealed his glory, and his disciples put their faith in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples. There they stayed for a few days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> In the temple courts he found men selling cattle, sheep and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple area, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> To those who sold doves he said, "Get these out of here! How dare you turn my Father's house into a market!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> His disciples remembered that it is written: "Zeal for your house will consume me." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Then the Jews demanded of him, "What miraculous sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> The Jews replied, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> But the temple he had spoken of was his body.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said. Then they believed the Scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many people saw the miraculous signs he was doing and believed in his name. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all men.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> He did not need man's testimony about man, for he knew what was in a man.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="3">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> He came to Jesus at night and said, "Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God. For no-one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> In reply Jesus declared, "I tell you the truth, no-one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> "How can a man be born when he is old?" Nicodemus asked. "Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb to be born!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, no-one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> You should not be surprised at my saying,`You must be born again.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> "How can this be?" Nicodemus asked.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> "You are Israel's teacher," said Jesus, "and do you not understand these things?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> No-one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven--the Son of Man. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Now John also was baptising at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were constantly coming to be baptised.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> (This was before John was put in prison.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> They came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan--the one you testified about--well, he is baptising, and everyone is going to him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> To this John replied, "A man can receive only what is given him from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> You yourselves can testify that I said,`I am not the Christ but am sent ahead of him.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> He must become greater; I must become less.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> "The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no-one accepts his testimony.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him." </VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="4">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> The Pharisees heard that Jesus was gaining and baptising more disciples than John,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> although in fact it was not Jesus who baptised, but his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> When the Lord learned of this, he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Now he had to go through Samaria.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, "Will you give me a drink?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> (His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> The Samaritan woman said to him, "You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?" (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.) </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> "Sir," the woman said, "you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his flocks and herds?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Jesus answered, "Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water so that I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> He told her, "Go, call your husband and come back."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> "I have no husband," she replied. Jesus said to her, "You are right when you say you have no husband.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> "Sir," the woman said, "I can see that you are a prophet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Our fathers worshipped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Jesus declared, "Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshippers the Father seeks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> God is spirit, and his worshippers must worship in spirit and in truth."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> The woman said, "I know that Messiah" (called Christ) "is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Then Jesus declared, "I who speak to you am he."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no-one asked, "What do you want?" or "Why are you talking with her?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> "Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?" </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> They came out of the town and made their way towards him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Meanwhile his disciples urged him, "Rabbi, eat something."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> But he said to them, "I have food to eat that you know nothing about."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> Then his disciples said to each other, "Could someone have brought him food?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> "My food," said Jesus, "is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Do you not say,`Four months more and then the harvest'? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Even now the reaper draws his wages, even now he harvests the crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Thus the saying`One sows and another reaps' is true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labour."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, "He told me everything I ever did."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> And because of his words many more became believers.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> They said to the woman, "We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Saviour of the world."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> After the two days he left for Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> (Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honour in his own country.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, for they also had been there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> "Unless you people see miraculous signs and wonders," Jesus told him, "you will never believe."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> The royal official said, "Sir, come down before my child dies."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> Jesus replied, "You may go. Your son will live." The man took Jesus at his word and departed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> When he enquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, "The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> Then the father realised that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, "Your son will live." So he and all his household believed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> This was the second miraculous sign that Jesus performed, having come from Judea to Galilee.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="5">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Here a great number of disabled people used to lie--the blind, the lame, the paralysed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, "Do you want to get well?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> "Sir," the invalid replied, "I have no-one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Then Jesus said to him, "Get up! Pick up your mat and walk."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a Sabbath,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> and so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, "It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> But he replied, "The man who made me well said to me,`Pick up your mat and walk.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> So they asked him, "Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, "See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews persecuted him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Jesus said to them, "My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Jesus gave them this answer: "I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, to your amazement he will show him even greater things than these.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Moreover, the Father judges no-one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> that all may honour the Son just as they honour the Father. He who does not honour the Son does not honour the Father, who sent him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> "I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> I tell you the truth, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> "Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> and come out--those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> "If I testify about myself, my testimony is not valid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> There is another who testifies in my favour, and I know that his testimony about me is valid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> "You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> "I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the very work that the Father has given me to finish, and which I am doing, testifies that the Father has sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> You diligently study the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the Scriptures that testify about me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> yet you refuse to come to me to have life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> "I do not accept praise from men,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> How can you believe if you accept praise from one another, yet make no effort to obtain the praise that comes from the only God? </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> "But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?"</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="6">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Some time after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias),</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the miraculous signs he had performed on the sick.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> The Jewish Passover Feast was near.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming towards him, he said to Philip, "Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Philip answered him, "Eight months' wages would not buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> "Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Jesus said, "Make the people sit down." There was plenty of grass in that place, and the men sat down, about five thousand of them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, "Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they began to say, "Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> When they had rowed three or three and a half miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water; and they were terrified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> But he said to them, "It is I; don't be afraid."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realised that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Once the crowd realised that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, "Rabbi, when did you get here?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, you are looking for me, not because you saw miraculous signs but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. On him God the Father has placed his seal of approval."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Then they asked him, "What must we do to do the works God requires?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Jesus answered, "The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> So they asked him, "What miraculous sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Our forefathers ate the manna in the desert; as it is written:`He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> "Sir," they said, "from now on give us this bread."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Then Jesus declared, "I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all that he has given me, but raise them up at the last day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> At this the Jews began to grumble about him because he said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> They said, "Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say,`I came down from heaven'?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> "Stop grumbling among yourselves," Jesus answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> "No-one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> It is written in the Prophets:`They will all be taught by God.' Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> No-one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> I tell you the truth, he who believes has everlasting life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> I am the bread of life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> Your forefathers ate the manna in the desert, yet they died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which a man may eat and not die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live for ever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55"> For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56"> Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57"> Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58"> This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your forefathers ate manna and died, but he who feeds on this bread will live for ever."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59"> He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="60"> On hearing it, many of his disciples said, "This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="61"> Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, "Does this offend you?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="62"> What if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="63"> The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="64"> Yet there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="65"> He went on to say, "This is why I told you that no-one can come to me unless the Father has enabled him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="66"> From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="67"> "You do not want to leave too, do you?" Jesus asked the Twelve.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="68"> Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="69"> We believe and know that you are the Holy One of God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="70"> Then Jesus replied, "Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="71"> (He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray him.)</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="7">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> After this, Jesus went around in Galilee, purposely staying away from Judea because the Jews there were waiting to take his life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> But when the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Jesus' brothers said to him, "You ought to leave here and go to Judea, so that your disciples may see the miracles you do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> No-one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret. Since you are doing these things, show yourself to the world."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> For even his own brothers did not believe in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Therefore Jesus told them, "The right time for me has not yet come; for you any time is right.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify that what it does is evil.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> You go to the Feast. I am not yet going up to this Feast, because for me the right time has not yet come."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Having said this, he stayed in Galilee.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> However, after his brothers had left for the Feast, he went also, not publicly, but in secret.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Now at the Feast the Jews were watching for him and asking, "Where is that man?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Among the crowds there was widespread whispering about him. Some said, "He is a good man." Others replied, "No, he deceives the people."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> But no-one would say anything publicly about him for fear of the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Not until halfway through the Feast did Jesus go up to the temple courts and begin to teach.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> The Jews were amazed and asked, "How did this man get such learning without having studied?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Jesus answered, "My teaching is not my own. It comes from him who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> If anyone chooses to do God's will, he will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> He who speaks on his own does so to gain honour for himself, but he who works for the honour of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law. Why are you trying to kill me?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> "You are demon-possessed," the crowd answered. "Who is trying to kill you?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Jesus said to them, "I did one miracle, and you are all astonished.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Yet, because Moses gave you circumcision (though actually it did not come from Moses, but from the patriarchs), you circumcise a child on the Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Now if a child can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, why are you angry with me for healing the whole man on the Sabbath?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Stop judging by mere appearances, and make a right judgment."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> At that point some of the people of Jerusalem began to ask, "Isn't this the man they are trying to kill?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Here he is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying a word to him. Have the authorities really concluded that he is the Christ? </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> But we know where this man is from; when the Christ comes, no-one will know where he is from."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, "Yes, you know me, and you know where I am from. I am not here on my own, but he who sent me is true. You do not know him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> but I know him because I am from him and he sent me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> At this they tried to seize him, but no-one laid a hand on him, because his time had not yet come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Still, many in the crowd put their faith in him. They said, "When the Christ comes, will he do more miraculous signs than this man?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> Jesus said, "I am with you for only a short time, and then I go to the one who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> You will look for me, but you will not find me; and where I am, you cannot come."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> The Jews said to one another, "Where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him? Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> What did he mean when he said,`You will look for me, but you will not find me,' and`Where I am, you cannot come'?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> On the last and greatest day of the Feast, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> On hearing his words, some of the people said, "Surely this man is the Prophet."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> Others said, "He is the Christ." Still others asked, "How can the Christ come from Galilee?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> Does not the Scripture say that the Christ will come from David's family and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> Thus the people were divided because of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> Some wanted to seize him, but no-one laid a hand on him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> Finally the temple guards went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, "Why didn't you bring him in?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> "No-one ever spoke the way this man does," the guards declared.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> "You mean he has deceived you also?" the Pharisees retorted.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> "Has any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> No! But this mob that knows nothing of the law--there is a curse on them."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number, asked,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> "Does our law condemn a man without first hearing him to find out what he is doing?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> They replied, "Are you from Galilee, too? Look into it, and you will find that a prophet does not come out of Galilee."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> Then each went to his own home.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="8">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered round him, and he sat down to teach them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> and said to Jesus, "Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, "If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Jesus straightened up and asked her, "Woman, where are they? Has no-one condemned you?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> "No-one, sir," she said. "Then neither do I condemn you," Jesus declared. "Go now and leave your life of sin."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> The Pharisees challenged him, "Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Jesus answered, "Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no-one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> But if I do judge, my decisions are right, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father, who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Then they asked him, "Where is your father?" "You do not know me or my Father," Jesus replied. "If you knew me, you would know my Father also."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> He spoke these words while teaching in the temple area near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no-one seized him, because his time had not yet come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Once more Jesus said to them, "I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> This made the Jews ask, "Will he kill himself? Is that why he says,`Where I go, you cannot come'?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> But he continued, "You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am [the one I claim to be], you will indeed die in your sins."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> "Who are you?" they asked. "Just what I have been claiming all along," Jesus replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> "I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is reliable, and what I have heard from him I tell the world."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> So Jesus said, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am [the one I claim to be] and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Even as he spoke, many put their faith in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, "If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> They answered him, "We are Abraham's descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it for ever.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> I know you are Abraham's descendants. Yet you are ready to kill me, because you have no room for my word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> I am telling you what I have seen in the Father's presence, and you do what you have heard from your father." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> "Abraham is our father," they answered. "If you were Abraham's children," said Jesus, "then you would do the things Abraham did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> As it is, you are determined to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> You are doing the things your own father does." "We are not illegitimate children," they protested. "The only Father we have is God himself."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and now am here. I have not come on my own; but he sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don't you believe me?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> He who belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> The Jews answered him, "Aren't we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> "I am not possessed by a demon," said Jesus, "but I honour my Father and you dishonour me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> I tell you the truth, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> At this the Jews exclaimed, "Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that if anyone keeps your word, he will never taste death.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> Jesus replied, "If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55"> Though you do not know him, I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and keep his word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56"> Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57"> "You are not yet fifty years old," the Jews said to him, "and you have seen Abraham!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="58"> "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="59"> At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="9">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> "Neither this man nor his parents sinned," said Jesus, "but this happened so that the work of God might be displayed in his life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> As long as it is day, we must do the work of him who sent me. Night is coming, when no-one can work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Having said this, he spat on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man's eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> "Go," he told him, "wash in the Pool of Siloam" (this word means Sent). So the man went and washed, and came home seeing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> His neighbours and those who had formerly seen him begging asked, "Isn't this the same man who used to sit and beg?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Some claimed that he was. Others said, "No, he only looks like him." But he himself insisted, "I am the man."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> "How then were your eyes opened?" they demanded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> He replied, "The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> "Where is this man?" they asked him. "I don't know," he said.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man's eyes was a Sabbath.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. "He put mud on my eyes," the man replied, "and I washed, and now I see."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath." But others asked, "How can a sinner do such miraculous signs?" So they were divided.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Finally they turned again to the blind man, "What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened." The man replied, "He is a prophet."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> The Jews still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man's parents.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> "Is this your son?" they asked. "Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> "We know he is our son," the parents answered, "and we know he was born blind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don't know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for already the Jews had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ would be put out of the synagogue.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> That was why his parents said, "He is of age; ask him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. "Give glory to God," they said. "We know this man is a sinner."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> He replied, "Whether he is a sinner or not, I don't know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Then they asked him, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> He answered, "I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples, too?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Then they hurled insults at him and said, "You are this fellow's disciple! We are disciples of Moses!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don't even know where he comes from."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> The man answered, "Now that is remarkable! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly man who does his will.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> To this they replied, "You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!" And they threw him out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> "Who is he, sir?" the man asked. "Tell me so that I may believe in him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Jesus said, "You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Then the man said, "Lord, I believe," and he worshipped him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> Jesus said, "For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, "What? Are we blind too?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> Jesus said, "If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="10">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> "I tell you the truth, the man who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a robber.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> The man who enters by the gate is the shepherd of his sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> The watchman opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognise a stranger's voice."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Jesus used this figure of speech, but they did not understand what he was telling them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Therefore Jesus said again, "I tell you the truth, I am the gate for the sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> All who ever came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. He will come in and go out, and find pasture.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> The hired hand is not the shepherd who owns the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> "I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> just as the Father knows me and I know the Father--and I lay down my life for the sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life-- only to take it up again.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> No-one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> At these words the Jews were again divided.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Many of them said, "He is demon-possessed and raving mad. Why listen to him?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> But others said, "These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Then came the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> and Jesus was in the temple area walking in Solomon's Colonnade.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> The Jews gathered round him, saying, "How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Jesus answered, "I did tell you, but you do not believe. The miracles I do in my Father's name speak for me,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> but you do not believe because you are not my sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no-one can snatch them out of my hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no-one can snatch them out of my Father's hand.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> I and the Father are one."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Again the Jews picked up stones to stone him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> but Jesus said to them, "I have shown you many great miracles from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> "We are not stoning you for any of these," replied the Jews, "but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your Law,`I have said you are gods'?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> If he called them`gods', to whom the word of God came-- and the Scripture cannot be broken--</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said,`I am God's Son'?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Do not believe me unless I do what my Father does.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> But if I do it, even though you do not believe me, believe the miracles, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped their grasp.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptising in the early days. Here he stayed</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> and many people came to him. They said, "Though John never performed a miraculous sign, all that John said about this man was true."</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="2"> This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> So the sisters sent word to Jesus, "Lord, the one you love is sick."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> When he heard this, Jesus said, "This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for God's glory so that God's Son may be glorified through it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Yet when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Then he said to his disciples, "Let us go back to Judea."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> "But Rabbi," they said, "a short while ago the Jews tried to stone you, and yet you are going back there?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours of daylight? A man who walks by day will not stumble, for he sees by this world's light.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> It is when he walks by night that he stumbles, for he has no light."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> After he had said this, he went on to tell them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going there to wake him up."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> His disciples replied, "Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Jesus had been speaking of his death, but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> So then he told them plainly, "Lazarus is dead,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Then Thomas (called Didymus) said to the rest of the disciples, "Let us also go, that we may die with him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> On his arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> "Lord," Martha said to Jesus, "if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Martha answered, "I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> "Yes, Lord," she told him, "I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> And after she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. "The Teacher is here," she said, "and is asking for you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> "Where have you laid him?" he asked. "Come and see, Lord," they replied.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Jesus wept.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Then the Jews said, "See how he loved him!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> But some of them said, "Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> "Take away the stone," he said. "But, Lord," said Martha, the sister of the dead man, "by this time there is a bad odour, for he has been there four days."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> Then Jesus said, "Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, "Father, I thank you that you have heard me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, "Take off the grave clothes and let him go."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. "What are we accomplishing?" they asked. "Here is this man performing many miraculous signs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, "You know nothing at all!</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> You do not realise that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="51"> He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="52"> and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="53"> So from that day on they plotted to take his life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="54"> Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the Jews. Instead he withdrew to a region near the desert, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="55"> When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="56"> They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple area they asked one another, "What do you think? Isn't he coming to the Feast at all?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="57"> But the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone found out where Jesus was, he should report it so that they might arrest him.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="12">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Six days before the Passover, Jesus arrived at Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Here a dinner was given in Jesus' honour. Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Then Mary took about a pint of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus' feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> "Why wasn't this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year's wages." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> "Leave her alone," Jesus replied. "[It was intended] that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and putting their faith in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> The next day the great crowd that had come for the Feast heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, "Hosanna!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" "Blessed is the King of Israel!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> "Do not be afraid, O Daughter of Zion; see, your king is coming, seated on a donkey's colt." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realise that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Many people, because they had heard that he had given this miraculous sign, went out to meet him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> So the Pharisees said to one another, "See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. "Sir," they said, "we would like to see Jesus."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Jesus replied, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> I tell you the truth, unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honour the one who serves me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> "Now my heart is troubled, and what shall I say?`Father, save me from this hour'? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Father, glorify your name!" Then a voice came from heaven, "I have glorified it, and will glorify it again."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Jesus said, "This voice was for your benefit, not mine.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> But I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> The crowd spoke up, "We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain for ever, so how can you say,`The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this`Son of Man'?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> Then Jesus told them, "You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. The man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Put your trust in the light while you have it, so that you may become sons of light." When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Even after Jesus had done all these miraculous signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> This was to fulfil the word of Isaiah the prophet: "Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?" </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> "He has blinded their eyes and deadened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn--and I would heal them." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not confess their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="43"> for they loved praise from men more than praise from God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="44"> Then Jesus cried out, "When a man believes in me, he does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="45"> When he looks at me, he sees the one who sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="46"> I have come into the world as a light, so that no-one who believes in me should stay in darkness.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="47"> "As for the person who hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="48"> There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; that very word which I spoke will condemn him at the last day.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="49"> For I did not speak of my own accord, but the Father who sent me commanded me what to say and how to say it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="50"> I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="13">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> It was just before the Passover Feast. Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> The evening meal was being served, and the devil had already prompted Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, to betray Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel round his waist.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped round him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Jesus replied, "You do not realise now what I am doing, but later you will understand."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> "No," said Peter, "you shall never wash my feet." Jesus answered, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> "Then, Lord," Simon Peter replied, "not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Jesus answered, "A person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet; his whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. "Do you understand what I have done for you?" he asked them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> "You call me`Teacher' and`Lord', and rightly so, for that is what I am.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> I tell you the truth, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> "I am not referring to all of you; I know those I have chosen. But this is to fulfil the scripture:`He who shares my bread has lifted up his heel against me.'</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> "I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe that I am He.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> I tell you the truth, whoever accepts anyone I send accepts me; and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> After he had said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified, "I tell you the truth, one of you is going to betray me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> His disciples stared at one another, at a loss to know which of them he meant.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, "Ask him which one he means."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Leaning back against Jesus, he asked him, "Lord, who is it?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> Jesus answered, "It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish." Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, son of Simon.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him. "What you are about to do, do quickly," Jesus told him,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> but no-one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the Feast, or to give something to the poor.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out. And it was night.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> When he was gone, Jesus said, "Now is the Son of Man glorified and God is glorified in him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> If God is glorified in him, God will glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify him at once.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> "My children, I will be with you only a little longer. You will look for me, and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now: Where I am going, you cannot come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> "A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Simon Peter asked him, "Lord, where are you going?" Jesus replied, "Where I am going, you cannot follow now, but you will follow later."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> Peter asked, "Lord, why can't I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Then Jesus answered, "Will you really lay down your life for me? I tell you the truth, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times!</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="1"> "Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> You know the way to the place where I am going."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No-one comes to the Father except through me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> Jesus answered: "Don't you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say,`Show us the Father'?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you are not just my own. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the miracles themselves.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> "If you love me, you will obey what I command.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="23"> Jesus replied, "If anyone loves me, he will obey my teaching. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.</VERS>

			<VERS vnumber="9"> in regard to sin, because men do not believe in me;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> in regard to righteousness, because I am going to the Father, where you can see me no longer;</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> and in regard to judgment, because the prince of this world now stands condemned.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> "I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> He will bring glory to me by taking from what is mine and making it known to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will take from what is mine and make it known to you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> "In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Some of his disciples said to one another, "What does he mean by saying,`In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me,' and`Because I am going to the Father'?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> They kept asking, "What does he mean by`a little while'? We don't understand what he is saying."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him about this, so he said to them, "Are you asking one another what I meant when I said,`In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me'?</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> I tell you the truth, you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come; but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> So with you: Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and you will rejoice, and no-one will take away your joy.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> In that day you will no longer ask me anything. I tell you the truth, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> "Though I have been speaking figuratively, a time is coming when I will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my Father.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> In that day you will ask in my name. I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> No, the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> I came from the Father and entered the world; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Then Jesus' disciples said, "Now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Now we can see that you know all things and that you do not even need to have anyone ask you questions. This makes us believe that you came from God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> "You believe at last!" Jesus answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> "But a time is coming, and has come, when you will be scattered, each to his own home. You will leave me all alone. Yet I am not alone, for my Father is with me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world."</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="17">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> After Jesus said this, he looked towards heaven and prayed: "Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> I have brought you glory on earth by completing the work you gave me to do.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> "I have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours; you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> For I gave them the words you gave me and they accepted them. They knew with certainty that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> All I have is yours, and all you have is mine. And glory has come to me through them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> I will remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name--the name you gave me--so that they may be one as we are one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe by that name you gave me. None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction so that Scripture would be fulfilled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> "I am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the world, so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> They are not of the world, even as I am not of it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> For them I sanctify myself, that they too may be truly sanctified.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> "My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> I in them and you in me. May they be brought to complete unity to let the world know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> "Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> "Righteous Father, though the world does not know you, I know you, and they know that you have sent me.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> I have made you known to them, and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them."</VERS>

		<CHAPTER cnumber="18">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> When he had finished praying, Jesus left with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley. On the other side there was an olive grove, and he and his disciples went into it.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Now Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with his disciples.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> So Judas came to the grove, guiding a detachment of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and Pharisees. They were carrying torches, lanterns and weapons.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Jesus, knowing all that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, "Who is it you want?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> "Jesus of Nazareth," they replied. "I am he," Jesus said. (And Judas the traitor was standing there with them.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> When Jesus said, "I am he," they drew back and fell to the ground.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Again he asked them, "Who is it you want?" And they said, "Jesus of Nazareth."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> "I told you that I am he," Jesus answered. "If you are looking for me, then let these men go."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled: "I have not lost one of those you gave me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Jesus commanded Peter, "Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Then the detachment of soldiers with its commander and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus. They bound him</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> and brought him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it would be good if one man died for the people.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest's courtyard,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> but Peter had to wait outside at the door. The other disciple, who was known to the high priest, came back, spoke to the girl on duty there and brought Peter in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> "You are not one of his disciples, are you?" the girl at the door asked Peter. He replied, "I am not."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> It was cold, and the servants and officials stood round a fire they had made to keep warm. Peter also was standing with them, warming himself.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> "I have spoken openly to the world," Jesus replied. "I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> When Jesus said this, one of the officials near by struck him in the face. "Is this the way you answer the high priest?" he demanded.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> "If I said something wrong," Jesus replied, "testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Then Annas sent him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> As Simon Peter stood warming himself, he was asked, "You are not one of his disciples, are you?" He denied it, saying, "I am not."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, "Didn't I see you with him in the olive grove?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a cock began to crow.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Then the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness the Jews did not enter the palace; they wanted to be able to eat the Passover.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> So Pilate came out to them and asked, "What charges are you bringing against this man?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> "If he were not a criminal," they replied, "we would not have handed him over to you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Pilate said, "Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law." "But we have no right to execute anyone," the Jews objected.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken indicating the kind of death he was going to die would be fulfilled.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> "Is that your own idea," Jesus asked, "or did others talk to you about me?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> "Am I a Jew?" Pilate replied. "It was your people and your chief priests who handed you over to me. What is it you have done?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews. But now my kingdom is from another place."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> "You are a king, then!" said Pilate. Jesus answered, "You are right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> "What is truth?" Pilate asked. With this he went out again to the Jews and said, "I find no basis for a charge against him.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release`the king of the Jews'?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> They shouted back, "No, not him! Give us Barabbas!" Now Barabbas had taken part in a rebellion.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="19">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> and went up to him again and again, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!" And they struck him in the face.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews, "Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, "Here is the man!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, "Crucify! Crucify!" But Pilate answered, "You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> The Jews insisted, "We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> and he went back inside the palace. "Where do you come from?" he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> "Do you refuse to speak to me?" Pilate said. "Don't you realise I have power either to free you or to crucify you?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Jesus answered, "You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jews kept shouting, "If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha).</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> It was the day of Preparation of Passover Week, about the sixth hour. "Here is your king," Pilate said to the Jews.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> But they shouted, "Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!" "Shall I crucify your king?" Pilate asked. "We have no king but Caesar," the chief priests answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified. So the soldiers took charge of Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha).</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Here they crucified him, and with him two others--one on each side and Jesus in the middle.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, "Do not write`The King of the Jews', but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> "Let's not tear it," they said to one another. "Let's decide by lot who will get it." This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled which said, "They divided my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing." So this is what the soldiers did.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing near by, he said to his mother, "Dear woman, here is your son,"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> and to the disciple, "Here is your mother." From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Later, knowing that all was now completed, and so that the Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, "I am thirsty."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus' lips.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> When he had received the drink, Jesus said, "It is finished." With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jews did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="32"> The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="33"> But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="34"> Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="35"> The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="36"> These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: "Not one of his bones will be broken," </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="37"> and, as another scripture says, "They will look on the one they have pierced." </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="38"> Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jews. With Pilate's permission, he came and took the body away.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="39"> He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="40"> Taking Jesus' body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="41"> At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no-one had ever been laid.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="42"> Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was near by, they laid Jesus there.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="20">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Both were running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> Then Simon Peter, who was behind him, arrived and went into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> as well as the burial cloth that had been around Jesus' head. The cloth was folded up by itself, separate from the linen.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> Finally the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> (They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.)</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Then the disciples went back to their homes,</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> but Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> and saw two angels in white, seated where Jesus' body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> They asked her, "Woman, why are you crying?" "They have taken my Lord away," she said, "and I don't know where they have put him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> At this, she turned round and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realise that it was Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> "Woman," he said, "why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?" Thinking he was the gardener, she said, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned towards him and cried out in Aramaic, "Rabboni!" (which means Teacher).</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> Jesus said, "Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet returned to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them,`I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: "I have seen the Lord!" And she told them that he had said these things to her.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> Again Jesus said, "Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> And with that he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> Now Thomas (called Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> So the other disciples told him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he said to them, "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="26"> A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="27"> Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="28"> Thomas said to him, "My Lord and my God!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="29"> Then Jesus told him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="30"> Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="31"> But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.</VERS>
		</CHAPTER>
		<CHAPTER cnumber="21">
			<VERS vnumber="1"> Afterwards Jesus appeared again to his disciples, by the Sea of Tiberias. It happened this way:</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="2"> Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="3"> "I'm going out to fish," Simon Peter told them, and they said, "We'll go with you." So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="4"> Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realise that it was Jesus.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="5"> He called out to them, "Friends, haven't you any fish?" "No," they answered.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="6"> He said, "Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some." When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="7"> Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, "It is the Lord," he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="8"> The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards. </VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="9"> When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="10"> Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish you have just caught."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="11"> Simon Peter climbed aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="12"> Jesus said to them, "Come and have breakfast." None of the disciples dared ask him, "Who are you?" They knew it was the Lord.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="13"> Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="14"> This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="15"> When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon son of John, do you truly love me more than these?" "Yes, Lord," he said, "you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my lambs."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="16"> Again Jesus said, "Simon son of John, do you truly love me?" He answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Take care of my sheep."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="17"> The third time he said to him, "Simon son of John, do you love me?" Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, "Do you love me?" He said, "Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my sheep.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="18"> I tell you the truth, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="19"> Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, "Follow me!"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="20"> Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, "Lord, who is going to betray you?")</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="21"> When Peter saw him, he asked, "Lord, what about him?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="22"> Jesus answered, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me."</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="23"> Because of this, the rumour spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?"</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="24"> This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.</VERS>
			<VERS vnumber="25"> Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.</VERS>
